        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Estuarine wetland communities are affected by tidal waters in and along the sounds and drowned river mouths (see Section 4.2.14). The community includes brackish marsh, salt marsh, salt flats, and salt shrub components. In addition to the components described here, sand flats, mud flats, and algal mats are part of the estuarine community.</p>\n*Salt marshes occur where tides regularly flood the area with undiluted sea water. This environment of repeated flooding and exposure and higher salinity levels limit the diversity of plant species that occur in salt marshes to only a few species. Much of the productivity  in salt marshes is likely below ground in organic materials. Saltmarsh and Saltmeadow cordgrasses dominate these communities, and only a few other vascular plants occur. Algae may also be an important part of plant productivity.  The abundance of invertebrates such as mollusks and crustaceans indicates the transitional nature of these communities between terrestrial and marine systems.\n*Brackish marshes occur in areas where the tidal waters are partly diluted by fresh water. They are low in plant diversity, with Black Needlerush usually dominating vast areas.\n*Salt flats occur in fairly small areas of slight depression at the upper edge of salt or brackish marshes. Salty water floods these areas only occasionally. Once flooded, the water is trapped in the depression and evaporates, leaving salt concentrated in the soil. Vegetation is usually a sparse collection of extremely salt-tolerant plants such as Saltgrass and Glasswort. The center of the salt flat may be completely barren.\n*Salt shrub communities occur on the upper edge of salt and brackish marshes, where saltwater rarely reaches or where salt is diluted by fresh water seepage. They are dominated by salt-tolerant shrubs with marsh herbs often occurring in openings.</p><p>Estuarine islands are not considered a wetland community but they are particularly important for nesting terns, [[Black Skimmer|skimmers]], pelicans, wading birds, and [[American Oystercatcher|American Oystercatchers]]. Most have been created  by deposition of dredged material but there are a few that are natural islands. Dredged material islands are usually devoid of mammalian predators and have the added advantage of being high enough in elevation that ground nesting birds do not lose their nests during normal high tides. Estuarine communities were described as a priority habitat  in the 2005 WAP (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Lower river portions of aquatic communities in the Roanoke, Tar–Pamlico, Neuse, Cape Fear, White Oak, Chowan, and Pasquotank river basins are associated with estuarine wetland communities. The shorelines of the Albemarle–Pamlico estuary system and the sound-side of the Outer Banks barrier islands are also fringed by estuarine wetlands.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n==Dredging==\n<p>Dredging and dredge material placement can also affect these sites through draining  of marshes or filling of wetlands. Dredged material placement has been used very effectively in some areas to create marsh or upland bird nesting areas within the estuaries. Competition with coastal towns that use dredged sand for nourishment projects along developed beachfronts and constraints to navigation channel dredging projects limits access to dredged material for bird nesting islands.</p><p>Land Use. Development has impacted much of this habitat  type and armoring shorelines to prevent erosion is a growing problem. Predation by nonnative predators and disturbance by people and their pets of nesting birds and the lack of fire to maintain the vegetation structure in marsh sites is also of concern. Beach stabilization projects (e.g., inlet channel relocation and efforts to restrict channel movement) reduce availability of microhabitats such as mud and algal flats around inlets. Ditching can drain estuarine wetlands, disrupt normal hydrologic cycles, contribute to water quality problems by conducting point source discharges into nearby surface waters, and be a conduit for saltwater intrusion.</p>\n==Water Quality==\n<p>Water quality impacts from pesticide use (related to mosquito control), secondary impacts from development, and water flow impacts caused by ditching and canals have greatly affected this habitat.  Failing septic systems, sewage treatment and marina cleanout effluents, stormwater runoff, industrial organic waste discharge,  and agricultural fertilizers or animal wastes contribute excessive nutrients that can result in eutrophication and algal blooms. Mats of algae block sunlight from penetrating the water and will impact sea grasses. Low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels can result from algal die-off and decay and excessive algae growth can result in brown or red tides and harmful blooms, such as Pfiesteria piscicida, that have been associated with fish kills (EPA 2012b).</p>\n==Climate Change==\n<p>Climate change impacts, primarily sea level rise, will lead to shifts in plant composition and more open water habitats. An increase in the number of storm events and storm severity will result in more flooding and erosion of vegetation. The presence of drainage ditches will facilitate saltwater intrusion into more inland natural communities and rapid decomposition of peat soils by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Hackney and Yelverton 1990). Other problems will include subsidence and increased inundation of freshwater communities and release of previously sequestered carbon as carbon dioxide and methane (Hackney and Yelverton 1990).</p\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Climate change, particularly rising sea level and the potential erosion of barrier islands, is the greatest threat to estuarine wetland communities.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Many bird species associated with these community types have experienced significant declines according to inventory and survey data. Several priority bird species, such as the [[Seaside Sparrow]], [[Northern Harrier]], [[American Bittern]], and [[Black Rail]], are ground nesters in estuarine marsh habitats. If marsh habitat  does not migrate inland at comparable rates to habitat  losses, these birds may be displaced permanently due to fragmentation and competition pressures. Waterbird species that are colonial nesters are vulnerable to loss of habitat because they have relatively few nesting locations. Beach-nesting birds, sea turtles, and terrapins are more likely to have their nests washed over as sea level rises.</p><p>[[American Black Duck|Black Duck]]s also nest in brackish marshes. This species will lose nesting habitat  as inundation drowns currently occupied marshes. Climate change will have a significant effect on brackish waterfowl impoundments, which provide high-quality habitats to breeding and wintering waterfowl and other shore and wading birds. Many of these areas will be lost to sea level rise.</p><p>Losses, drastic alteration, or disturbance of estuarine communities (especially marsh habitats) could have serious consequences for nutrient cycling and for reproduction of marine and estuarine organisms (Schafale and Weakley 1990). Some reptile species, including sea turtles, terrapins, and [[American Alligator]]s, exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. With predicted increases in overall temperatures associated with climate change, it is possible that offspring sex ratios of these species may be affected (Hawkes et al. 2009).</p><p>Several rare, disjunct, or endemic species—[[Carolina Watersnake]], Aaron’s Skipper, and several moths—are associated with brackish marsh habitats in the sounds of the northern Coastal Plain. The drastic changes in salinity and wave action that are likely to occur if the Outer Banks are breached may drastically affect these species, possibly leading to their extirpation or extinction. If they survive the initial effects of the barrier island breach, however, they may be able to spread to new areas of brackish marsh that will form farther inland on the mainland side of the sounds.</p><p>Nutria are a nonnative and invasive mammal in freshwater and coastal marshes and wetlands, inland freshwater streams and rivers, and surface water impoundments. As warming trends increase, the range of Nutria is likely to expand and populations currently limited by intolerance to cold winters will quickly expand. There is some anecdotal evidence Nutria will take over and expand smaller next burrows of native wildlife such as [[Muskrat]]s, thereby displacing native species. Nutria may also be a vector for diseases (tuberculosis and septicemia) or parasites (Giardia, Fasciola, Liver Flukes, and nematodes), with fecal contamination in water the likely pathway (Carr 2010).</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Mountain and Piedmont bogs are among the rarest natural communities in the Southern Appalachians and in North Carolina. Unlike northern bogs of glacial origin, Southern Appalachian bogs form in poorly drained depressions or on gentle slopes, generally in relatively flat valley bottoms which are not subject to flooding. They may vary from being permanently wet to intermittently dry and are generally fed by seepage. They are underlain by wet organic or mucky mineral soils, which are very acidic.</p><p>The factors responsible for creating and maintaining bog communities are not well known. Grazing has been nearly universal in bogs, and few examples exist in pristine condition. Most are experiencing invasion of shrubs or trees at the expense of the herbaceous zones. This tendency toward rapid succession suggests that some form of periodic or chronic natural disturbance, now disrupted, may have kept the bogs open. Potential past disturbances include flooding by Beavers, grazing by herds of large mammals, fires, and clearing by Native Americans.</p><p>There are three community types within this ecosystem: Southern Appalachian bog, Southern Appalachian fen, and swamp forest–bog complex:\n*The Southern Appalachian bog and Southern Appalachian fen types have a mosaic or zoned pattern of shrub thickets and herb-dominated areas, mostly underlain by sphagnum mats. Trees may be scattered throughout or may dominate on the edges. The shrub and herb layers of the bog, while not highly diverse, are uniquely adapted to the acidic, nutrient-poor environment of the bog and may include numerous rare species. Fens occur on high pH (basic) soils, but otherwise have the same vegetative zones as bogs; only one Southern Appalachian fen is known in North Carolina (in Ashe County).\n*Swamp forest-bog complex types occur along streams and are dominated by trees, but may have boggy herbs and sphagnum moss in canopy openings.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP described bogs and associated wetlands (mountain bogs) as a priority habitat in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains ecoregion (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Mountain bogs (including fens and ‘wet meadow’ bogs) are distributed throughout the Mountains and upper Piedmont of North Carolina, with examples as far east as Forsyth and Gaston Counties. Most of the known occurrences of Southern Appalachian bogs and fens are situated above the Blue Ridge escarpment, in the northwestern (Ashe and Alleghany) and southern (Henderson, Transylvania)  counties. On the other hand, ‘wet meadow’ bogs can be found in the western half of the Piedmont and throughout the Mountain counties. Over 60% of the wetlands identified in the Southern AppalachianAssessment (SAMAB 1996 in NCWRC 2005) occurred on privately owned lands and it is likely that overall, the percent of mountain bog habitat  in private ownership is even greater.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n==Invasive Species==\n<p>Invasive species are already a problem in some areas and may increase with drought and warmer temperatures. Some bogs are subject to invasion by exotic plants such as Japanese Stiltgrass, Multiflora Rose, and Asian Dayflower. Many of these communities contain pines, hemlocks, or spruces, which are susceptible to insect pests.</p><p>Drought and warm temperatures may allow generalists and upland species to invade. Many of the rare species associated with mountain bogs and fens are herbs and are vulnerable to competition from woody species and more aggressive habitat  generalists. If changes  in hydrology make these sites drier, this problem is likely to be exacerbated.</p><p>Climate Impacts. Besides stream flooding, overland runoff from adjacent uplands during severe storms would be a problem in many bogs. The nutrient input and potential scouring of severe floods would be detrimental to bog communities. Droughts would have significant effects on competitive relationships among species and on the community as a whole. Many bogs may reduce in size if margins dry out due to drought. Some estimates indicate that fewer than 500 acres of mountain bogs in North Carolina remain  (USFWS 2002).</p>\n==Fragmentation==\n<p>The most common types of fragmentation occur when streams are impounded to form lakes, highways are built across inhabited wetlands, and wetland habitat units are drained for agricultural use or development. Roads that bisect Bog Turtle wetlands are the single most detrimental threat to turtle populations. Highway mortality is high in areas where turtles must cross roads to get from one wetland to another (Somers et al. 2000).</p>\n==Successional Conversion==\n<p>Bog communities can undergo ecological succession, from open canopy fens and bogs to closed canopy swamps (where hydrologic conditions do not change), leading to the loss of habitat  suitable for Bog Turtles and other species dependent on these types of wetlands (Klemens 1993; Herman and Tryon 1997; Rosenbaum et al. 2007).</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.</p><p>Climate change effects such as droughts and severe flooding may be particularly problematic in these communities. Climate change, however, is not likely to be as detrimental compared to impacts caused by a number of immediate threats that can cause more drastic destruction than climate change is likely to. The largest scale problem affecting mountain bogs and wetlands in general has been and continues to be the conversion of these habitats to other land uses. Table 4.15 summarizes the comparison of climate change with other existing threats.</p>\n\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Floodplains are defined as “areas of low lying land that are subject to inundation by lateral overflow water from rivers or lakes with which they are associated” (Junk and Welcomme 1990; Tockner and Stanford 2002). Other terms frequently used to refer to floodplains include alluvial forests, bottomlands, fluvial systems, riverine forests, or stream or riparian zones. Floodplains can be comprised of more than one community type since the timing, depth, and duration of flooding are considered the primary influence on plant species composition (Wharton et al. 1982; Kellison et al. 1998; Mitsch and Gosselink 2000; Burke et al.2003). The floodplain community will also be influenced by variations in soils and microenvironments that occur in the landscape adjacent to the aquatic community. In its natural state, floodplains have high biodiversity and productivity  as well as providing recreational and aesthetic values (Tockner and Stanford 2002).</p><p>Blackwater floodplains include the vegetated communities on the floodplains of blackwater rivers. Blackwater rivers are low gradient rivers in small watersheds where hydroperiods are characterized by short duration floods that may be deep and widespread, followed by extensive periods of lower discharge  (Burke et al. 2003). The flow often is not sustained, and extended droughts during the growing season can occur in these floodplains (Wharton et al. 1982; Burke et al. 2003).</p><p>Contrary to [[Floodplains-Brownwater Systems|brownwater rivers]], they carry little mineral sediments (e.g., clay and silt). Instead, the water chemistry in blackwater rivers is dominated by dissolved organic matter leached from decomposing vegetation and is generally low in pH and nutrients. The water is tea-colored but not cloudy. The soils of blackwater floodplains are usually sandy or mucky and are acidic and relatively infertile. Many floodplains, particularly the larger ones, have at least some development of depositional features such as natural levees, point bars, and ridge-and-swale systems, but these are not as large or prominent as on [[Floodplains-Brownwater Systems|brownwater rivers]]. Many smaller blackwater floodplains are filled with muck and are flat and featureless.</p><p>\nCommunities that occur in blackwater floodplains include: Coastal Plain levee forest and bottomland hardwoods on the larger floodplains, cypress-gum swamps in the wettest and forested parts of the floodplain, Coastal Plain small stream swamps, Coastal Plain semi-permanent impoundments (e.g., Beaver ponds, millponds), oxbow lakes along the large rivers in abandoned channel segments, and sand and mud bars along the rivers (Schafale and Weakley 1990).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Blackwater rivers originate in the Coastal Plain ecoregion and many are located in the lower portion of the river basins that drain to the Atlantic coast. Examples of blackwater streams and rivers include the South River, Black River, Waccamaw River, and the Northeast Cape Fear River. The Lumber River mainstem is the only North Carolina blackwater river designated as a National Wild and Scenic River.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>The floodplain forest systems of the Coastal Plain in the southeast are now only small fragments and sections of the original millions of acres present before European settlement that have been lost or altered by development, drainage, agriculture, and logging (Weller and Stegman 1977).</p>\n==Climate Variability==\n<p>Milder winters will result in potentially longer growing seasons and earlier bloom times for plants and earlier breeding periods for reptiles and amphibians. Most species in this habitat type have a southeastern distribution and are fairly well adapted to higher temperatures. Increased temperatures will likely result in decreased winter kills of nonnative species and will likely allow these species native to areas further south to survive and reproduce. Insect infestations may increase and negatively affect forest health. Drought conditions will allow invasion of upland species (e.g., Red Maples and beech). Some more southern species may migrate into these communities. Conversion of lower river areas to tidal marsh will allow the Common Reed to invade. Increased temperatures and decreased winter kills will allow southern species to move farther north (e.g., the Asian Dayflower, Japanese Climbing Fern, Chinese Tallow Tree).</p>\n==Storms==\n<p>Increased hurricane intensity will increase blow down, especially near the coast. Bottomland hardwoods are more likely to be affected by windthrow than other floodplain communities. Increased canopy gaps may result from increased storm wind damage and from flood scouring. Flooding could benefit canebrakes and their associated species, but both the magnitude and direction of the effects are uncertain. Species composition could change following storm damage, resulting in loss of mast-producing species. Increased severity of flooding may destabilize channels, alter sediment load and deposition, and increase erosion. Increased frequency may have beneficial effects but increased duration may kill species not adapted to long periods of inundation. More large floods might mean increased river area with increased instability of bars. This would come at the expense of forests along the river banks, which are often the least altered forests in the floodplains. If flood frequency increases, it might also cause the boundaries between bottomland hardwoods and cypress-gum swamp to shift. Effects on species composition are unknown but changes to the overall community structure are likely, especially in lower reaches that may eventually convert to marsh.</p>\n==Sea Level Rise==\n<p>Saltwater intrusion associated with sea level rise is expected to have significant adverse effects on lower reaches of blackwater floodplains where it is likely to affect long-term survivability of canopy species. Saltwater intrusion will affect long-term survivability of canopy species in the lower floodplain reaches. Wetlands close to the Cape Fear River near [w:Wilmington] and the lower portion of the Scuppernong River near Columbia have already been impacted. No expansion of this community type is possible upstream and expansion into the [[Piedmont]] is not possible for this ecosystem. Consequently, the net effect from climate change will be an overall loss of acreage. Because there is not substantial potential for the floodplain systems to expand inland, there will be a net loss in area.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.</p><p>Changes in flood regimes and rising sea level are the most important climate effects. Most Coastal Plain wetland communities, including blackwater systems, may be moderately vulnerable to climate change, depending on importance of precipitation and riverine flooding for hydrologic inputs. Direct loss of wetlands due to sea level rise is expected to be the greatest threat in coastal landscapes (DeWan et al. 2010). However, these systems will remain common.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Loss of old growth characteristics (canopy gaps, vine tangles, hollow trees, dead and downed woody material) and fragmentation of stands is a major concern. A lack of standing dead or older trees has impacted the availability of quality bat and [[Chimney Swift]] roosting and breeding sites and nesting productivity  for species such as [[Wood Duck]] and [[Hooded Merganser]].  Removing woody debris from streams after storms has influenced in-stream habitat  structure and food webs. Lack of downed woody debris has impacted a variety of amphibians and reptiles.</p><p>Fragmentation of floodplain forest stands has contributed to the loss of intact large riparian corridors and the width of many riparian corridors has been greatly reduced. Breeding area-sensitive bottomland-hardwood birds have likely been impacted by the loss of intact woodland systems. Large patches of floodplain habitat  are lacking in much of the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]]. High-grading logging practices have changed plant species diversity and stand vegetative structure. Logging has reduced [[colonial waterbird]] and [[Bald Eagle]] nesting areas.</p><p>Alteration of hydrology due to dam creation and the draining  of wetlands are one of the primary problems affecting species in this habitat  type. The impacts of development adjacent to rivers and streams includes potential problems associated with direct input of contaminants and sediment, alteration of hydrologic patterns and processes, temperature regimes, and loss of critical habitat adjacent to aquatic habitat  that may be of equal importance to species that only spend a portion of their lives in the water, like some amphibians. Drainage of wetlands has exacerbated the problems in and adjacent to floodplain forest habitats. This habitat  loss impacts all floodplain species, including furbearers, breeding amphibians, overwintering birds, and migrant species that use these areas as stopover sites. Water quality is also an issue in certain major river drainages that negatively affects many invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles.</p><p>This ecosystem contains some extremely rare disjunct and near endemic plant species. Their rarity makes them vulnerable to changes in habitat. Random events in specific locations can have major impacts on the expected viability of whole species. Two cane-feeding moths are endemic (or nearly so) to the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Habitat for these species is divided between blackwater and brownwater floodplains, as well as peatlands. All of these species, plus the larger guild of cane-feeding insects, is likely to benefit from increased canopy gaps and other disturbances associated with climate change.</p><p>Diversity of “native” species may potentially  increase due to movement of more southerly species northward into this habitat  type (e.g., [[Wood Stork]], [[Swallow-tailed Kite]], water elms, water locusts). The [[Wood Stork]] has expanded its breeding range in the state and is now nesting at several blackwater stream/river sites. More substantial changes may occur in floodplains north of North Carolina, beyond the current range of widespread southern floodplain species.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>This ecosystem group includes the vegetated communities that occur on brownwater floodplains. In contrast to [[Floodplains-Blackwater Systems|blackwater rivers]], they carry heavy loads of mineral sediment, particularly clay and silt. The water is generally near neutral pH and high in nutrients. The deposition of sediment in the floodplain provides a periodic nutrient input that keeps the soils rich. Depositional topographic features such as natural levees, point bars, ridge-and-swale systems, and sloughs are well developed, with their size depending on the size of the river.</p><p>There are seven communities that occur in Coastal Plain brownwater floodplains: Levee Forests, Bottomland Hardwoods, Small Stream Swamps, Cypress–Gum Swamps, Semipermanent Impoundments, Oxbow Lakes, and Sand and Mud Bars (Schafale and Weakley 1990).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Brownwater rivers originate in the Mountains or Piedmont and flow eastward  into the Coastal Plain ecoregion. Brownwater floodplain forests of various conditions and sizes can be found throughout the Coastal Plain ecoregion; however, the majority of them are associated with the Roanoke, Tar–Pamlico, Neuse, and Cape Fear rivers. The condition of Coastal Plain floodplain forests of all types have been greatly reduced in recent years throughout North Carolina and the entire southeast (Weller and Stegman 1977; Schafale and Weakley 1990) by a variety of anthropogenic factors.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n==Flooding==\n<p>Factors that impact these systems include flooding regime patterns that have been changed by dams and other development, habitat  fragmentation, changes in water chemistry and organic matter loads, increased nitrogen from agricultural and development-related runoff, exotic species and high-grading of stands and logging that reduces  wide buffers. All of these factors individually or interactively produce abrupt or gradual changes in floodplain plant and wildlife communities. In particular, the sediment load in many brownwater rivers is now a major problem in the Coastal Plain, and even many blackwater systems now have high sediment loads (Schafale and Weakley 1990).</p><p>Increased frequency and/or severity of flooding will likely have a mix of positive and negative influences. Changes in rainfall regime may also induce water management that produces more floods of unnatural, destructive long duration. If floods become more extreme, channels may begin to migrate more. Increased scouring by more severe floods would create more early successional bar communities at the expense of mature communities on the banks. Increased magnitude of floods could affect higher terraces that now see little flooding. Leigh (2008) and Leigh et al. (2004) suggest that Coastal Plain rivers may be near a threshold for switching to a braided channel morphology. More large floods might mean increased area but reduced stability of sand and mud bars. Given the water availability in floodplains, drought is unlikely to stress floodplain ecosystems. The effect will be mostly in the form of allowing upland species to invade.</p>\n==Climate Variability==\n<p>Inundation from sea level rise will create wholesale change to a tidal system in the downstream portions. Large expanses in these areas will shift to tidal swamps. Saltwater intrusion would likely affect long-term survivability of canopy species in the lower floodplain reaches. Saltwater intrusion could occur further upstream during floods or high storm surge.</p><p>Increased wind disturbance may cause some shifts in species composition, such as favoring sweetgum and loblolly pine over oaks in bottomland hardwoods. These will be relatively small compared to the past and ongoing similar effects of logging, but will exacerbate them. Increased wind damage would decrease average canopy age and increase the proportion of gaps. Increased tree growth rates may offset the structural effect to some degree. Bottomland hardwoods will likely be most affected by structural and compositional changes from increased wind storms.</p><p>No significant inland migration is possible for this community so there will be a net loss of acreage, mostly caused by inundation from rising sea level. Some Coastal Plain species may be able to expand into the Piedmont as the climate warms, but many of the differences between brownwater and inland floodplains are the result of geology rather than climate. There is an expectation that nonnative plants (e.g., Chinese Privet, Japanese Stiltgrass, Japanese Honeysuckle) will increase and there will likely be additional invasive species, such as the Chinese Tallow Tree.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define short and long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable to persist. Other than rising sea level, the effects of climate change are particularly uncertain in these systems.</p><p>Changes in flood regimes and rising sea level are the most important climate effects. Climate change effects upstream of the tidal zone are likely to be limited and other existing threats are likely to be more significant.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>The few brownwater floodplains generally occur far apart on the landscape, are not hydrologically connected, and few have north–south courses, making it difficult for plants and animals confined to brownwater floodplains to move northward as suitable conditions are lost.</p><p>Large patches of floodplain habitat  are absent in much of the Coastal Plain. Fragmentation of stands has contributed to the loss of intact large riparian corridors and the width of many riparian corridors has been greatly reduced. Breeding area–sensitive bottomland-hardwood birds have likely been impacted by the loss of large patches of intact woodland systems. [[Swallow-tailed Kite]] is an area-sensitive species and is now known to breed within the state along the Cape Fear River. High-grading of stands has changed plant species diversity and stand vegetative structure. Forestry activities (e.g., logging) have reduced colonial waterbird and [[Bald Eagle|eagle]] nesting areas, but wading birds make more use of timber-cleared wetlands for foraging.</p><p>Two cane-feeding moths are endemic to the region but also occur in [[Floodplains-Blackwater Systems|blackwater floodplains]] and non-riverine swamp forests. Another cane-feeding moth appears to be significantly disjunct within the lower Cape Fear floodplain. Two hawthorn-feeding moths also appear to have disjunct populations in the lower Roanoke floodplain, as does the [[Cerulean Warbler]]. None of these species appear likely to be affected by climate change-related impacts.</p><p>Drainage of wetlands has exacerbated the problems in and adjacent to floodplain forest habitats. This habitat loss impacts all floodplain species, including furbearers, breeding amphibians, overwintering birds, and migrant species that use these areas as stopover sites. Water quality is also an issue in certain major river drainages that negatively affects many invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles (NCWRC 2005).</p><p>Long-duration flooding has had impacts on all ground-nesting bird species. Loss of old growth characteristics (canopy gaps, vine tangles, hollow trees, dead and downed woody material) and fragmentation of stands is a major concern. A lack of standing dead or older trees has impacted the availability of quality bat and [[Chimney Swift]] roosting and breeding sites and nesting productivity  for species such as the [[Wood Duck]] and [[Hooded Merganser]]. Lack of downed woody debris has impacted a variety of amphibians and reptiles (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Summary=\n<p>In general, protection and restoration of natural composition and function, and protection of surrounding natural areas are the best way to improve the ability of these communities to adapt to climate change. Protection of a large and diverse pool of examples is the best way to ensure that many survive the future stresses.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>For this natural community description, Inland Floodplains are forested communities associated with freshwater systems of various conditions and sizes and are located primarily in the Mountain, Piedmont, and Sandhills ecoregions. Depending on landscape position and soil moisture gradients, some of the wetland communities described in Section 4.3 may also be part of the inland floodplain community; however, in this description, floodplain forests are considered the dominant community type.</p><p>Floodplain systems in the Coastal Plain ecoregion may be associated with blackwater rivers (originating in the Coastal Plain) or brownwater rivers (originating in the Piedmont or Mountains but flowing into the Coastal Plain). Floodplains in the Coastal Plain are typically characterized as broad alluvial features that may be inundated for prolonged periods every year with low gradient meandering streams that terminate in tidal estuaries (Hupp 2000). Separate community descriptions are provided for the [[Floodplains-Blackwater Systems|blackwater]] and [[Floodplains-Brownwater Systems|brownwater floodplains]] (see Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4, respectively) because of their unique characteristics.</p><p>In the [[Piedmont]] and [[Sandhills]] ecoregions, floodplain forests generally do not contain the significant recognizable elevation differences seen in the larger coastal floodplain systems. In these smaller floodplains, the relief and size of the fluvial landforms (levees, sloughs, and ridges) that differentiate the communities in large floodplains become smaller and harder to find (Schafale and Weakley 1990). In larger and more expansive examples of these floodplains, the forest canopy contains a good mixture of bottomland and mesophytic (moderately moisture tolerant) plant species.</p><p>Floodplain forests of the [[Southern Blue Ridge|Mountain]] ecoregion are relatively narrow and do not contain well-developed levees, sloughs, and ridges. Smaller high gradient streams often do not have representative floodplains, but instead have riparian zones embedded within other habitat types such as isolated patches of various wetland communities (Schafale and Weakley 1990). Mountain floodplains are subject to sporadic  high-intensity flood events of short duration.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Floodplain forests of some type are found beside most rivers and streams in the Piedmont and Sandhills ecoregions. They are of varying widths, depending on the topography of land adjacent to the river, and the transition between floodplain and upland forest is often gradual. Mountain floodplains are generally restricted to larger streams and rivers with relatively low gradients of the valley landscape.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n==Flooding==\n<p>Natural floodplains are biologically productive and diverse ecosystems that are among the most threatened due to habitat  alteration, flow and flood control, invasive species, and pollution (Tockner and Stanford 2002). The condition of floodplain forests of all types has been greatly reduced in recent years throughout North Carolina and the entire southeast (Weller and Stegman 1977; Schafale and Weakley 1990) by a variety of anthropogenic factors. Factors that impact these systems in North Carolina include flooding regime patterns that have been changed by dams and other development, habitat  fragmentation, changes in water chemistry and organic matter loads, increased nitrogen from agricultural and development-related runoff, exotic species, and high-grading of stands and logging that reduces  wide buffers. All of these factors individually or interactively produce abrupt or gradual changes in floodplain plant and wildlife communities.</p><p>Long-duration flooding has had impacts on all ground-nesting bird species. Loss of old growth characteristics (canopy gaps, vine tangles, hollow trees, dead and downed woody material) and fragmentation of stands is a major concern. A lack of standing dead or older trees has impacted the availability of quality bat and [[Chimney Swift]] roosting and breeding sites and nesting productivity for species such as Wood Duck and Hooded Merganser. Lack of downed woody debris has impacted a variety of amphibians and reptiles.</p>\n==Land Use==\n<p>Logging and clearing land for agriculture, development, recreational use, and reservoir construction all cause direct loss and alteration of floodplain forests. In the past half century, an estimated 52% of bottomland forests in the south have been cleared for agriculture or development (Smith et al. 2002). Land clearing activities conducted adjacent to, and up and downstream of floodplain forests can cause indirect impacts to the floodplains, particularly related to hydrology. Areas adjacent to floodplains are often prime targets for general development and subdivisions, and buffer size is often inadequate to provide any protection from a variety of anthropomorphic disturbances over time. For instance, flooding events may occur with greater frequency in some areas due to increased upstream impervious surfaces and clearing of vegetation near buffers.</p><p>Snags play a very important role in providing nesting, foraging, and roosting areas for many cavity-nesting birds, bats, arboreal mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Lack of snags and den trees is often a limiting factor for several species of wildlife, especially secondary cavity users (McComb et al. 1986). Younger riparian forests can also lack dead wood on the ground, which is important for some songbirds (like the [[Kentucky Warbler]]), many reptiles, amphibians, and some small mammals.</p><p>Dams can alter the timing and duration of flood events. Alteration of hydrology due to dam creation and the draining  of wetlands changes plant communities and also affects the availability of ephemeral wetlands for breeding amphibians. Building ditches and canals in floodplains dramatically alters hydrology and is often done to prepare a floodplain for agriculture, forestry, or development. Even in abandoned sites, ditches will continue to alter the hydrology for many decades. Habitat loss from wetland drainage impacts all floodplain species, including furbearers, breeding amphibians, overwintering birds, and migrant species that use these areas as stopover sites.</p><p>Fragmentation of forest stands has contributed to the loss of intact large riparian corridors and the width of many riparian corridors has been greatly reduced. Breeding area-sensitive bottomland-hardwood birds have likely been impacted by the loss of intact woodland systems. High-grading of stands has changed plant species diversity and stand vegetative structure. Forestry activities (e.g., logging) have reduced colonial waterbird and [[Bald Eagle|eagle]] nesting areas. Clearing of adjacent uplands can increase edge effects and limit the effective size of floodplain forest habitat.</p>\n==Water Quality==\n<p>Sewer lines have been constructed along many floodplain corridors, especially in urbanized areas. These corridors fragment floodplain forests and allow conditions for invasion of exotic plant species. Poor water quality due to nutrient inputs, reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, sedimentation, and chemical contamination (among others) can have a strong impact on amphibians, turtles, and other animals associated with floodplain forests that forage or breed in aquatic areas, in addition to the direct impacts on fully aquatic species. Sediment pollution is a major problem in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. Beaver activity and the creation of beaver ponds in floodplain forest can have substantial impacts on trapping sediment and associated pollutants.</p>\n==Invasives==\n<p>Increases in amounts of non-native plants (e.g., Chinese Privet, Japanese Stiltgrass, Japanese Honeysuckle) and the overall loss of large canebreaks are partly due to the lack of infrequent fire and also certain logging practices. Understory vegetative diversity has declined in many areas due to modified flooding regimes and increases in invasive nonnative plant species. The reduction in overall plant diversity is often extensive due to these invasive nonnative plants and may cause problems for native fauna, though the extent of wildlife impacts is largely unknown.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>While climate change may not be the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of this community type, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of soil type and depth, elevation of groundwater, and the timing and duration of precipitation.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>The vegetative cover of some floodplains was historically maintained in Switch Cane and herbaceous plants through fire and other periodic disturbance. Small remnants of “canebrake” communities still exist throughout the Piedmont, but management strategies to maintain this feature are almost nonexistent. Migratory landbirds that use switch cane areas for breeding include [[Hooded Warbler]], [[Kentucky Warbler]], and [[Swainson's Warbler]].</p><p>Floodplains are also important as movement corridors for mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Birds use riparian corridors at all times of the year and these areas are especially important to neotropical migrants during the migration periods. Indeed, floodplain forests generally have the highest nesting bird concentrations in the state and they are arguably the most important habitats for birds. Floodplain pools that occur in small depressions and are flooded for a portion of the year generally have few or no trees and are especially important sites for breeding amphibians such as [[Spotted Salamander]], [[Marbled Salamander]], [[Four-toed Salamander]], and many frogs.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Freshwater tidal wetlands occur in sites where flooding occurs in response to lunar or wind tides, but where the water has less than the 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salt content used to define freshwater. Tidal freshwaters occur in rivers, where freshwater flow keeps out saltwater, and along the large sounds where distance from seawater inlets keeps the water fresh. Components of this habitat  include: tidal cypress-gum swamps and tidal freshwater marshes:</p>\n*Tidal cypress-gum swamps occupy vast areas at the mouths of large rivers and also occur at the mouths of smaller creeks and occasionally along the sound shoreline. They are dominated by Swamp Black Gum, Water Tupelo, and Bald Cypress. Understory tree, shrub, and herb layers are generally sparse and low in diversity.\n*Tidal freshwater marshes occur in the lowermost parts of some tidal rivers and creeks and, more commonly, in large flats along the shorelines of freshwater sounds. The vegetation is generally strongly zoned and often very diverse in at least some zones. Two distinct variants are recognized, one with very slightly salty (oligohaline) water, the other completely fresh. The 2005 WAP describes tidal swamp forest and wetland communities as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>These habitats occur along rivers or sounds in areas where flooding is influenced by lunar or wind tides. Fresh water input may heavily influence the salt content (NCWRC 2005). Tidal cypress–gum swamps are extensive along shorelines and along drowned river valleys (e.g. Cape Fear, Neuse, and Chowan rivers). The most extensive examples can be found around Albemarle Sound areas, Alligator River, and at the mouths of the Cape Fear, Neuse, Tar, and Roanoke rivers. Tidal freshwater marshes are common around the margins of Currituck Sound, and occur in smaller areas, such as in the Cape Fear River just west of Wilmington.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n==Erosion==\n<p>Erosion control measures may help protect these communities, but measures that alter the shoreline, whether sea walls, “soft” structures, or planting off-site species, are potentially destructive to these communities. Shoreline armoring and hardening to protect infrastructure will prevent ecosystems such as tidal marshes from migrating inland (DeWan et al. 2010). As development continues inland, water demands in the Piedmont will affect freshwater flows from the major rivers that feed this system through water removals.</p>\n==Flooding==\n<p>Alteration of flood regimes in rivers may affect these systems. Some areas are fresh largely, or at least partly, because of the dilution of sea water by river input. Increased water withdrawal  or interbasin transfer may increase this problem in the future. The effects are local, affecting primarily the mouth of the altered rivers, but could be important cumulatively. Existing drainage ditches and canals bringing saltwater into wetlands is a serious threat. Saltwater intrusion is already impacting former forests in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge near the intersection of US 64 and US 264, and in the lowest portion of the Scuppernong River at Columbia. Tide gates or blocking ditches are needed to slow, if not eliminate, some saltwater intrusion. However, saltwater intrusion into Albemarle Sound and into the Scuppernong River cannot be controlled by tide gates or blocking ditches.</p>\n==Logging==\n<p>This ecosystem group is likely to experience drastic changes in extent and significant movement of communities that are logged. Logging is a threat to some tidal cypress– gum swamps, while others are in protected status or are too wet for logging equipment. Drying may create opportunities for logging these wet areas.</p><p>Small plants of low interior marshes appear to need fire to maintain their habitat.  Lack of fire allows unnatural vegetation succession in some freshwater marshes. Common Reed, Chinese Tallow Tree, Alligator Weed, and Nutria are primary invasive species concerns.</p><p>The disruptions created by shifting communities and catastrophic events may increase the spread of Common Reed. Giant Salvinia could become a problem. Early control of species that have proven more invasive farther south will be less costly and less ecologically disruptive than allowing populations to become large.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Changes caused by rising sea level are the greatest threat, but increased intensity of storms, both in rainfall and wind, are also important. Because these systems are so subject to sea level, tidal movement, water salinity, and storms, these effects of climate change are the greatest threats.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>No terrestrial animals are endemic to this ecosystem group within North Carolina. Manatees, [[Roseate Spoonbill]]s, and possibly other species may be able to persist in North Carolina in the future climate with warmer weather. Coastal freshwater wetlands provide important habitats for bitterns, rails, and a variety of other wading and shore birds. Conversion of other habitats, especially tidal forests, to tidal freshwater marsh will occur over time, which means availability of this habitat  for nesting, cover, and forage may briefly increase; however, in the long term, location and amount of such marshes is uncertain (DeWan et al. 2010).</p><p>Tidal freshwater wetlands provide nursery habitat  for aquatic species that live in saltwater but rely on fresh and brackish waters for larval recruitment and development. Many of these species are economically or commercially important, such as crabs, shrimp, and flounder species (DeWan et al. 2010). Coastal freshwater wetlands are also important to furbearers, waterfowl, and other game species.</p><p>The Rare Skipper (''Problema bulenta'') occurs solely within tidal freshwater marshes throughout its range, from New Jersey to southern Georgia. Dukes’ Skipper (''Euphyes dukesi'') is also restricted to these habitats along the Atlantic coastal portion of its range, although it also occurs inland in Florida, and in the Midwest region. Although the reasons for these restrictions are not clear, the larvae of both species feed on plants that occur well inland from the coast, even in North Carolina. Both of these species are potentially susceptible to extirpation from the state if they or their specialized habitats cannot keep pace with the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion.</p><p>Nutria are considered a serious pest species in the United States because they eat a variety of wetland and agricultural plants and their burrowing damages streambanks, impoundments, and drainage systems. Nutria may also be a vector for diseases (tuberculosis and septicemia) or parasites (Giardia, Fasciola, Liver Flukes, and nematodes), with fecal contamination in water the likely pathway. As warming trends increase, the range of Nutria\nis likely to expand and populations currently limited by intolerance to cold winters will quickly expand (Carr 2010).</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Nonalluvial mineral wetlands occur on flat, poorly drained areas of the outer Coastal Plain and occasionally in shallow depressions such as Carolina bays. There may also be sites that fit this community description located in the [[Sandhills]] ecoregion. The soils in these sites are saturated in the wetter seasons, may have shallow standing water, and do not experience overflow flooding. The wetness comes from poor drainage and sheet flow from adjoining peatlands. The soils are less acidic and infertile than the peat soils of pocosins, but they do not have the regular nutrient input of river floodplains. Organic deposits are generally lacking, though occasional examples are found on organic soils where some other factor offsets the tendency of these soils to support pocosins.</p><p>In the wettest areas, bald cypress, swamp black gum, and red maple dominate. Where these areas transition to peatland, loblolly pine, pond pine, and Atlantic white cedar may also be present. In less saturated nonalluvial wetlands, trees characteristic of bottomland hardwood systems dominate: cherrybark oak, laurel oak, swamp chestnut oak, tulip poplar, sweetgum, American elm, and red maple. There are three community types that differ in wetness and the nature of the soil: non-riverine swamp forests, non-riverine wet hardwood forests, and wet marl forest.\n*Non-riverine swamp forests occur in the wettest sites. They are dominated by trees tolerant of extreme wetness, such as bald cypress, swamp black gum, and red maple. A distinctive variant, transitional to peatland communities, has these species mixed with loblolly pine, pond pine, and Atlantic white cedar.\n*Non-riverine wet hardwood forests occur in less wet areas. They are dominated by trees typically called “bottomland hardwoods.” The undergrowth is usually open beneath the closed canopy, but sometimes dense cane or shrubs occur.\n*The wet marl forest type occurs where marl or limestone occurs near the surface and affects the soil. This extremely rare community is completely isolated, and is fragmented. Although they are wet, these soils are not acidic and are more fertile than most Coastal Plain soils. The vegetation is dominated by a diverse mixture of tree, shrub, and herb layers. Dwarf palmetto is an abundant and distinctive part of the shrub layer.</p><p>The 2005 WAP described Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain nonalluvial mineral wetlands as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5)(NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Examples of this habitat  type can be found in the Alligator River, Swanquarter, and Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuges, Hoffmann Forest, Rocky Point, and several swamps (Van and East Dismal) in Washington County.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>The condition of nonalluvial mineral wetlands in the Coastal Plain is generally poor due\nto alteration of hydrology (primarily from draining  for farmland and conversion to loblolly pine plantations) and is rather fragmented. Some of the best remaining examples are on public lands such as on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge, and the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.</p><p>Nonalluvial mineral wetlands tend to be converted for forestry and agriculture more readily since the mineral soils can support heavy equipment better than organic soils, and they are more fertile. Much of this type existed in Beaufort and Pamlico counties until recent years; relatively little remains. A higher percentage of this habitat  type has probably been destroyed than any other type in the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]], with the exception of dry longleaf pine.</p><p>Fire suppression has led to a decline in diversity of these habitats but the alteration of hydrology from ditches associated with farming and forestry practices is the biggest factor impacting this habitat  type. Altered hydrology that drains these wetland types will decrease the ability to use prescribed fire as a management tool and increase the risk of catastrophic damage from wildfire. Non-native plant species (e.g., Chinese Privet, Japanese Stiltgrass) are also competing with native vegetation in many areas, especially those frequently disturbed. Although little of this quality habitat  remains, it can be burned more safely than those sites with organic soils. Therefore, the potential still exists to reestablish some high-quality nonalluvial mineral wetlands on the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, where it has not already been converted to farmland or ditched  for pine plantations.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define short and long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.</p><p>Climate change is a significant threat primarily because of the likelihood of inundation from sea level rise. Rising sea level will be more of a concern in the larger riverine wetlands at lower elevations, such as those around the Alligator River, than wetlands further inland. However, other threats such as logging and the alteration of hydrology, in the form of ditches, pose equal threats to these systems.</p><p>Impacts to the non-riverine swamps and hardwood stands in the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula, which include the largest blocks of habitats of this ecosystem group in the state, are likely to be catastrophic. These stands are unlikely to be replaced by the development of new stands located farther inland.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>These sites are important for variety of neotropical migrants during the breeding season and migration periods (Hunter et al. 2000b; Johns 2004), and also several reptiles of conservation concern (NCWRC 2005). [[Wayne’s Black-throated Green Warbler]] is nearly confined to non-riverine swamp forests throughout its narrow range from Virginia to South Carolina. This taxon is declining throughout its range, and loss of the population on the [[Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula]] (believed to be the largest remaining) due to rising sea levels would significantly reduce the chances of its survival overall. Storm-related impacts to the [[Wayne’s Black-throated Green Warbler]] could be particularly severe, since it is a canopy-dwelling species that is often found in the vicinity of tall conifers (likely nesting sites) that emerge above a canopy of hardwoods (Fussell et al. 1995). Likewise, the coastal population of the [[Worm-eating Warbler]] uses this habitat type heavily and is isolated from other populations that breed in the Mountains of North Carolina.</p><p>Even more likely to become extirpated is the sole population of [[Wood Frog]]s known to occur in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. This population exists on the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula in the vicinity of hardwoods near Scranton and likely represents a relic from the Pleistocene epoch, as do several other animals and plants recorded in this area (e.g., cranberry, Sundew moth, undescribed shrew). The reasons for its restricted range in this area are unknown, but it may not be able to migrate inland to keep pace with sea level rise.</p><p>Nonriverine mineral wetlands are the primary habitat  for the [[Red Wolf]] in the state, with most individuals being present at Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes refuges. Other large mammals also utilize these habitats, such as Black Bear, Bobcat, and White-tailed Deer.</p><p>Other terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates associated with this ecosystem group occupy other types of habitat,  including floodplain forests and peatlands, and are more likely to survive impacts associated with climate change. Two species of Canebrake Moths, however, are endemic to the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|North Carolina Coastal Plain]] and the portion of the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia: ''Lascopia roblei'' and the still-undescribed Apameine, new genus 2, species 3. Some of their largest known populations are associated with non-riverine habitats, the loss of which would be significant, if not as damaging as for [[Wayne’s Black-throated Green Warbler]].</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Pocosin habitats are those parts of eastern North Carolina characterized by flooded, acidic, anaerobic soils with limited decomposition and accumulating biomass. Peat deposits develop where the soil is saturated for long enough  periods that organic matter cannot completely decompose. Once peat has developed, it holds water, raising water levels in the soil and making the site wetter. The shallow water tables and patterns of normal flooding result in anaerobic soil conditions that slow decomposition of biomass. Soils are acidic and nearly sterile, with available nutrients provided from periodic surface flooding of adjoining landscapes and from precipitation. The soils of streamhead pocosin habitats are flooded, acidic, and infertile.</p><p>Peatland pocosins occur on nearly flat, poorly drained areas of the outer Coastal Plain and in large shallow depressions such as Carolina bays. Streamhead pocosin habitats are patchy and limited to ravines that are permanently flooded by acidic seepage and run-off from adjacent hills. Fire history, hydrology, and drainage influence the composition of the community type, with some unfragmented examples occupying many thousands of acres.</p><p>Natural community types are determined by variation in wetness, depth of peat, and fire dynamics and include: streamhead pocosin, low pocosin, high pocosin, Pond Pine woodland, peatland and streamhead Atlantic White Cedar forest, and bay forest. The distinction between these community types may seem clear, but there are significant overlaps in the characteristics of the soils, wildlife, and plant species that occur across them.\n*Streamhead pocosin plant community compositions can range from dense shrub thickets to treeless canebrakes. The natural fire cycle results in open canopy pond pine forests. However, fire suppression leads to pond pine forests with a dense shrub understory. The understory is dominated by a dense evergreen shrub layer including several members of the laurel and holly families and is frequently tangled with Laurel-leaf Greenbrier. Herbs are nearly absent except in the edge (ecotone) with neighboring sandhill communities. These ecotones often support a high diversity of herb and shrub species including many rare ones.\n*Low pocosins occur on the deepest peats, in the interior of large domed  peatlands, and in the largest peat-filled Carolina bays. They are the wettest, most nutrient-poor sites and support only low shrubs and scattered stunted pond pine trees. Often beds of pitcher plants and sphagnum moss cover large areas and bog species such as cranberries occasionally occur.\n*High pocosins occur in somewhat less deep peats. The shrubs, up to six or eight feet tall and impenetrably dense, are generally laced together with greenbriers and punctuated with sparse stunted pond pines.\n*Pond Pine woodlands occur on shallow organic deposits on the edge of peatlands and in shallow swales and bays, where tree roots can grow through the thin organic layer to reach mineral soil below. Pond Pines are tall and often fairly dense and the shrub layer is tall and usually very thick. In some pond pine woodlands the dense shrub layer is replaced by canebrakes.\n*Peatland Atlantic White Cedar forests occur in sites similar to pond pine woodland or high pocosin but are dominated by Atlantic White Cedar instead of pond pine. In the few remaining places where fire is frequent, streamhead Atlantic White Cedar forests are dominated by Atlantic White Cedar, though any of the species of the streamhead pocosin type also may be present in small numbers. The canopy is often dense enough that the shrub layer is fairly open. Atlantic White Cedars are sensitive to fire, but depend on fire to prepare a seedbed for regeneration. These communities probably can persist only where fire is infrequent; however, fire suppression for many decades can lead to the cedars being overtaken by widespread hardwood species such as Red Maple or Sweetgum.\n*Bay forests may occur in similar sites, but they are usually more associated with creeks draining  out of peatland pocosins. They have a canopy dominated by evergreen hardwood Loblolly Bay, Redbay, and/or Sweetbay.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain]] pocosin communities as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Extensive examples of pond pine woodlands exist in the Green Swamp, at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges, Holly Shelter Game Land, and in Dare County at the Dare Bombing Range. Atlantic White Cedar-dominated communities still exist at Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Great Dismal Swamp. There is a significant sized stand of Atlantic White Cedar in the Buckridge Preserve (Tyrell County), the only inland site that is part of the NC Coastal Reserve.</p><p>Examples of fire-managed streamhead pocosin can be found on Sandhills Game Land, Fort Bragg, Croatan National Forest, and Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base. The Croatan National Forest, Dare Bombing Range, Camp Lejeune, and Holly Shelter Game Land do conduct some pocosin burns, but all other fire introduced into pocosin habitats tends to be on small acreages (less than 100 acres).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Peatland pocosin is a large, dominant habitat  in the eastern part of the state and once occupied nearly 3 million acres from Virginia to Florida, with about 70% occurring in North Carolina. Only about 750,000 acres remain, with most of the area lost used for agriculture, forestry, and peat mining.</p>\n==Logging==\n<p>Logging, particularly of Atlantic white cedar and pond pine stands, altered flood regime through ditching, constructing impoundments to store water, fire suppression, and conversion to agriculture or silviculture that fragment communities can significantly impact pocosin ecosystems. The hydrologic changes resulting from ditches and canals developed to drain peatland pocosins for agriculture and forestry reduce the water holding capacity of the ecosystem and can alter the chemistry of nearby estuaries. The ditches and canals result in the rapid drainage of rainwater into estuaries that become loaded with sediment and nutrients. The deluge of freshwater into estuaries causes salinity values to plummet while the nutrients cause eutrophication and oxygen depletion. The result is severe alteration of habitat  needed for wildlife in river mouths and estuaries near shore.</p>\n==Fire Suppression==\n<p>Fire return intervals vary widely depending on vegetation, hydrology, and extent of organic soils. Fire suppression takes the peatland pocosin out of the normal 25 to 50-year burn cycle and allows the build up of fuel, because the acidic habitat has slow decomposition and rates of soil formation. The build-up of fuel increases vulnerability to fires during dry summers. Impacts of fire suppression lead to larger, hotter fires in the vegetation and can cause ignition of peat fires that are difficult to extinguish. Similarly, the streamhead Atlantic White Cedar forest composition is affected by the fire cycle: fire suppression leads to accumulating fuel loads and a layer of thick, understory shrubs, and hardwood saplings.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Overall, climate change is not the most significant threat to peatland pocosins. The most pressing climate change impacts on peatland pocosins will be from intense precipitation events and intense fire events. Other important climate change events will be from wind damage to tree species that do not regenerate and saltwater intrusion from storm surge and sea level rise. Tropical storms are predicted to become more frequent, larger, and more intense with rainfall larger than in the past. Larger rainfalls connected with violent storms will add to drainage problems in estuaries.</p><p>Pocosins play an important role in climate change by acting as a carbon sink, thereby mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from human activities. The carbon gained by pocosin ecosystems through photosynthesis is taken from the atmosphere and stored in biomass that does not decompose. So the primary productivity  of pocosins offsets CO<sub>2</sub> emissions produced through use of fossil fuels and land use activities.</p><p>Pocosin communities can also be large carbon sources, adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. For example, if vegetation burns, CO<sub>2</sub> is released into the atmosphere adding to the greenhouse gas effect driving climate change. If peat burns, the CO<sub>2</sub> release will be much larger than from just the vegetation alone.</p><p>Predicted warmer temperatures and longer summer droughts will lead to increased fires. Burning vegetation and peat will generate large amounts of greenhouse gases. The change in landscape from large fires fed by climate change factors and fire suppression will burn hotter, longer, and cover more area than occurred in the natural fire cycle. The new burning cycle will compromise the quality of the habitat  needed by wildlife. Table 4.22 summarizes the comparison of climate change with other existing threats.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>In general, little detailed information exists for many wildlife species that use pocosin habitats because of the impenetrable nature of these communities. Few surveys have been done on a long-term basis, which makes land management decisions difficult. We also lack detailed information about populations of small mammals, bats, reptiles, and amphibians in pocosin habitats (Mitchell 1992). Black Bears are dependent on the large undisturbed areas that pocosins offer in the east. Further reduction in this habitat  type could impact bear populations.</p><p>The remoteness and thickness of the vegetation in the peatland pocosin makes it the ideal habitat  for resident and migratory species and protects them from human disturbance. Pocosins are particularly important for wintering birds because of the high amount of soft mast available. Greenbrier, Red Bay, Sweet Bay, and many ericaceous shrubs produce large Sandhill streamheads. These species occur in other types of habitat  and are not as confined to the [[Sandhills|Sandhills ecoregion]].</p><p>Pocosin habitats are important for a variety of shrub-scrub birds, though we lack status and distribution data (Karriker 1993). [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]] exists in some of these pond pine-dominated sites where suitable habitat  also occurs in the uplands. A study by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) in the Sandhills demonstrated a high territory density of shrub-nesting birds in fire-managed streamhead pocosin, including the [[Common Yellowthroat]], [[Indigo Bunting]], [[Eastern Towhee]], and [[Yellow-breasted Chat]]. This same study found a relatively high density of cavity nesters such as the [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]], [[Red-headed Woodpecker]], and [[Carolina Wren]]. Loss of this fire-maintained habitat has caused fragmentation of [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]] habitat  across the landscape. Fire-suppressed streamhead pocosins supported significantly lower densities  of nine bird species but had higher numbers of [[Carolina Chickadee]], [[Hooded Warbler]], and [[Red-eyed Vireo]].</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Small, isolated wetlands, such as upland pools and depressions, are important areas of diversity for plants and animals, especially specialized amphibians that require these habitats for breeding. Upland pools and depression communities occur in all regions of North Carolina. Typically, they include shallow depressions which hold water in wetter parts of the year. Many are ephemeral, drying during some part of the year (often in summer), but are flooded long enough  into the growing season to contain wetland vegetation that contrasts with the surrounding uplands. Water levels usually fluctuate over the course of a season, and also from year to year. Communities differ in overall hydroperiod, in soil, in slope, and in depth. Hydroperiod is the length of time that there is standing water at a particular location; it can also be defined as the number of days per year that an area of land is dry (Gaff et al. 2000). Some ephemeral (temporary) pools are wet enough  to accumulate muck on the bottom, while others remain sandy.</p><p>Upland pools and depressions can be categorized into one of several types, including the following:\n*Upland pools that occur in sites where the water is deep enough  or long-standing enough  to prevent development of a closed tree canopy. The vegetation varies widely, and it is likely that this type could be split into several community types. Trees of the upland depression swamp forest community type may occur around the edges.\n*Upland depression swamp forests that occur in shallower depressions than upland pools, and are flooded for shorter periods. They usually occur on broad upland flats but occasionally on high ridgetops. They have a closed canopy of wetland trees. Understory, shrubs, and ground cover are usually sparse.</p><p>*Ephemeral (temporary) pools that are small, seasonally flooded depressions with gently sloping sides and are usually found in sandy uplands.</p><p>*Seeps that occur along slopes where groundwater trickles out of the surface and collects in small pools and will often trickle into streams.\n*Clay-based upland depressions that typically occur as oval or round depressions with a clay base that allows them to hold water for at least a portion of the year. In the Sandhills and Coastal Plain, these depressions historically have had a Longleaf Pine upland where hot season fires burned regularly, creating an open-canopy, grassy wetland system with long hydroperiods. In the Coastal Plain and Sandhills ecoregions, pond basins may also be limesink depressions, Carolina bays, or swales between recent or older sand dunes.\n*Limestone sinks occur over limestone formations. Scattered trees (Pond Cypress and Swamp Blackgum) may be present in both deep and shallow water zones and most ponds are surrounded by a dense shrub layer. These shrubby zones provide breeding habitat  for shrub-scrub-nesting birds (Hunter et al. 2001a; Johns 2004) and these sites are used by wading birds for foraging/nesting and amphibians for breeding.\n*Swale wetlands occur on barrier islands, such as in the Outer Banks, in areas where the freshwater aquifer saturates the soil and collects on the surface between sand dunes. These ponds will also have dense maritime shrublands in areas where water is shallow; in deeper  water, they are characterized by emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation.\n*Carolina bays with organic/peat substrates are relatively deep closed basins associated with pocosins, depression swamps, Pond Pine woodlands, bay forests, or Atlantic White Cedar forests. Occasionally they occur in shallow depressions associated with nonriverine communities such as swamp forests, wet hardwood forests, and wet marl forests with nonalluvial mineral soils (NCNHP 2010).</p>\n<p>All of these natural community types often have abundant amphibian species. Those that dry annually or semi-annually benefit amphibians the most, due to the absence of fish, which would typically eat amphibian eggs and larvae. During heavy storm events, however, fish can be swept in by overbank flooding, reducing the suitability of these pools for amphibian breeding until they dry out again.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Upland depression communities occur throughout North Carolina but are often overlooked features on the landscape mainly because they are difficult to discern on aerial photographs unless they are quite large. In the Piedmont and in the Mountains, these small wetland communities can be found on broad upland flats and occasionally on high ridgetops. Ephemeral (temporary) pools are usually found in sandy uplands. Those that occur in the Piedmont are associated with mafic rocks or shale. Those in the Mountains occur on quartzite. Examples include Frogsboro Upland Depression Forest in [[Caswell Game Land]]; Badin Upland Depression Swamps in the [[Uwharrie National Forest]]; Meadow Flats in [[Duke Forest]]; and Bog Hole (Seventeen Frog Pond, Grassy Pond) in [[Sandhills Game Land]] in Scotland County (an unusually wet example, transitional to Small Depression Pond).</p><p>Carolina bays and limestone sinks are probably the best known examples of isolated wetlands in NC because they are easy to view on aerial or infrared photos of the region and they are generally obvious on the landscape. Carolina bays and clay-based upland depressions occur throughout the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]], whereas limestone sinks tend to occur in clusters in areas along the lower Coastal Plain—numerous limestone sinks are visible around the Boiling Spring Lakes area in Brunswick County, NC.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Isolated, ephemeral wetlands are regarded as one of the most endangered, and simultaneously one of the most biologically productive habitats in North America. Wetlands of this type are characterized by unique assemblages of flora and fauna that are not associated with permanent-water wetlands. In the Southeast, they serve as critical breeding habitat for several endangered species of amphibians. Many declining species of plants and animals depend on or use isolated, temporary wetlands. Across the Southeast, most of these systems have been lost to draining  for agriculture, commercial silviculture, and development. Others have been altered to retain the permanent water necessary to support fish populations. Further, many of the temporary wetlands that remain on the southeastern landscape have been greatly affected by lack of fire that would have naturally maintained them in an early successional condition. The resulting colonization by large overstory trees significantly alters these wetland systems such that they no longer support many of the rare species that depend on them.</p><p>The vegetation of upland ephemeral pools varies widely because of natural and human-induced differences among ponds. Factors related to human-induced changes such as ditching and lowering of water tables through agricultural and urban  uses has caused some pools to completely dry or revert to forested wetlands. Some upland ephemeral pools are maintained as open-canopy emergent wetlands because of naturally long hydroperiods that prevent the colonization of trees and shrubs (e.g., limestone sinks with a groundwater connection).</p><p>However, many upland, isolated wetlands would have historically been maintained as open, “grassy” ponds through a combination of hydroperiod and fire regime processes (DeSteven and Toner 2004). In these situations, summer fires would occasionally burn through the dry basins, limiting the establishment and growth of fire-intolerant woody species and controlling  the buildup of excessive amounts of peat (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 1990). Specifically, vegetation of clay-based depressions has been altered by fire suppression or exclusion in adjacent uplands, ditching of wetlands, or by intentional fire exclusion by maintaining fire lines around wetland habitats. Even where fire has been reintroduced into the Longleaf Pine ecosystem in the Southeast, most managers use winter or spring burning instead of hot, summer fires that would have naturally occurred in the past. Winter or spring fires usually do not burn through wetlands because water is often present in the pond basin at that time of year. Indeed,  fire suppression or exclusion has been linked to the encroachment of trees into historically treeless ponds in the Southeast (Kushlan 1990; Kirkman et al. 1999; De Steven and Toner 2004).</p><p>The reduction of open-canopy, ephemeral ponds is a major reason for the loss of populations of some southeastern amphibian species (e.g., Gopher Frog) that depend on them exclusively for breeding (LaClaire 2001). Additionally, the encroachment of trees into temporary wetlands can have multiple adverse effects on the larvae of many amphibian species (Schiesari 2006; Thurgate and Pechmann 2007; Werner and Glennemeier 1999). The most obvious effect is increased evapotranspiration in the pond resulting in a shorter hydroperiod (Sun et al. 2001). Shorter hydroperiods may not allow larval amphibians enough  time to reach metamorphosis (Skelly 2004).</p><p>Shading of ponds can also lower the pond’s water temperature, slowing the growth and development of larval amphibians (Blaustein et al. 1999; Skelly et al. 2002). Ponds with significant canopy cover may also suffer from lowered oxygen availability (Skelly et al. 2002) and reduced algal communities (Skelly and Golon 2003), both of which have detrimental effects on larval amphibian growth and survival. Further, increases in leaf litter associated with the establishment of overstory trees can substantially lower the pH in these degraded wetlands. Evidence exists that breeding habitats can indeed  become too acidic for the successful hatching and rearing of some southeastern amphibian larvae (Braswell 1993 and references therein).</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. In this comparison, the greatest threat to depression communities is likely to be habitat  conversion. Habitat conversion occurs for various reasons, including suppression of natural fire regimes, development, and land use changes. Drier basins are destroyed by development or conversion to pine plantations, while wetter ones are degraded by these activities on the surrounding uplands. In protected examples, alteration of hydrology and effects of fire suppression are usually the most serious threats.</p><p>Climate change is likely to exacerbate existing effects, increasing the number and severity of droughts and increasing the amount of evaporation even in years of normal rainfall. If increased drought and severe weather reduces  the ability to conduct prescribed burning, this may reduce fire even in the few examples that are getting burned. With respect to climate change, however, upland pools and their associated species are likely to respond differently from the surrounding forests. Table 4.23 summarizes the comparison of climate change with other existing threats.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Members of this community all make use of upland pools for breeding, but make use of floodplain pools as well, at least where they are fairly well isolated from frequent overbank flooding. Windthrow pits may also be used and Four-toed Salamanders, in particular, make frequent use of seepage habitats. All Piedmont wetland habitats are especially important as breeding sites for amphibian species. Small wetlands can also be important breeding habitat  for crayfishes. Wading birds, waterfowl, and songbirds may also use small wetland communities for nesting and feeding areas.</p><p>While often small in size, cumulatively these habitats provide critical breeding habitat for many amphibian species. Ephemeral and isolated wetlands are very valuable to amphibians because they typically do not support fish and other predators of amphibian eggs. The loss of ephemeral wetland communities in the Piedmont has strong ramifications for future amphibian populations. Amphibians in these communities depend on the surrounding uplands, and populations are lost or much reduced if the surrounding habitat  is destroyed or altered. Pool-breeding amphibians that make use of these pools may potentially be as adversely affected by these changes as those associated with upland pools are by increased frequency of drought.</p><p>Increased road densities  are correlated with declines in amphibian diversity and abundance (Vos and Chardon 1998; Findlay et al. 2001; Fahrig et al. 1995). Roads can cause heavy mortality for reptiles and amphibians and can effectively isolate breeding populations, or separate wetland habitats from upland habitats that are used during non-breeding portions of amphibian and reptile life cycles. The increase in impervious surfaces from the proliferation of roads causes excess stormwater runoff and pollution from point and nonpoint sources, which degrades water quality. Most amphibians are highly sensitive to changes in water quality.</p><p>All are likely to be strongly affected, particularly upland populations, by increases in prolonged droughts associated with climate change. Increased drawdown of groundwater levels, also the result of prolonged drought as well as increased human utilization,  particularly in times of surface water scarcity, is another major threat for populations associated with floodplain pools or seeps. Floodplain pool populations are additionally likely to be adversely affected by increases in overbank floods that carry fish into their breeding sites. These impacts may be offset to some extent, however, by increases in the number of windthrow pits resulting from heavier storm damage.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>The communities included in upland seepages and spray cliffs are wetlands that occur on sloping uplands and can be found across the state. The soils are generally saturated permanently or for long periods. They are generally fairly small and contrast sharply with adjacent communities, though boundaries may be gradational. There are four communities in this ecosystem group: spray cliffs, hillside seepage bogs, low elevation seeps, and high-elevation seeps. Spray cliffs are areas kept wet by spray from waterfalls. The other three community types are fed by groundwater seepage and their soils are saturated for much or all of the year, but they are seldom, if ever, flooded.\n*Most spray cliff areas are vertical cliffs, but gentle slopes, talus, and soil at the base of cliffs are also included. Vegetation is very patchy, reflecting the patchiness of soil accumulations. The microclimate is generally moderated by the flowing water and sheltered position of the cliffs. Though water flow may vary with rainfall, these are probably among the most stable environments in North Carolina. Trees rooted in crevices and between rocks often grow to large size and may shade the entire area. The bare wet rocks generally have a great diversity of mosses and liverworts. Herbs in small soil pockets include a wide variety of forbs, ferns, and sedges.\n*The rarest type is the hillside seepage bog. These communities, in a few Piedmont locations, are wet enough  to have boggy vegetation. The vegetation is generally a patchy mix of shrubs and herbs with an open tree canopy. Many species characteristic of the Coastal Plain occur in these communities. Fire may have played a role in keeping hillside seepage bogs open enough  to allow persistence of light-requiring bog species.\n*Low elevation seeps, occurring in uplands or edges of floodplain throughout much of the state, are also very wet but differ in vegetation. The factors which cause these differences are poorly known. Trees such as red maple may be present, or the seep may be shaded by canopy species from adjacent forests.\n*High-elevation seeps occur in the higher Mountains, where they are surrounded by spruce–fir forests, northern hardwood forests, or grass and heath bald communities. High-elevation seeps are quite variable in vegetation and setting. Some are open and somewhat boggy, with peat moss, sundews,  and even cranberries present. Others are shaded by canopy and more closely resemble a rich northern hardwood forest.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>This group of communities covers a wide geographic range in the Mountains and Piedmont ecoregions. High-elevation mountain seepage communities are usually surrounded by spruce–fir forests, northern hardwood forests, or grass and heath bald communities. Low-elevation seeps tend to occur at the bases of slopes in the Piedmont and lower Mountains, just above a floodplain. Spray cliffs are more likely to occur in gorges and riverine areas. Examples of spray cliffs can be found in the Nantahala National Forest, Bonas Defeat Gorge on the Tuckasegee River in Jackson County, Reid Branch waterfalls in Transylvania County, Phillips Branch waterfalls in Caldwell County, and the Dismal Creek waterfalls in Transylvania County (Stevenson  2015).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Threats to individual seepages and spray cliffs are extremely variable and include: invasive plants; death of Canada hemlock trees due to the [[Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]]; development on or adjacent to the community; recreational trampling;  stream flooding and scouring or downcutting; depletion of ground water pools that supply seepage; ditching or drainage; increased temperatures in sheltered refugia; and vegetational succession in the absence of fire or other natural disturbance. This ecosystem is highly threatened overall, with or without climate change.</p><p>The communities located at high elevations are the most likely to be affected by increased temperatures. Some distinctive high-elevation species may be lost, while some lower elevation species may be able to migrate into them. Warmer temperatures may allow exotic species to invade. Some seeps have increased in tree cover due to fire suppression or other alterations, and loss of tree cover may be positive in some examples.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.</p><p>The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of these communities, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of rocks, soil depth, size of groundwater pools, and amount of overland runoff. These systems are tied to specialized small environments and will be unable to migrate as the climate changes. Many may change very little, while a few will shrink, be disturbed by wind or flood, or change substantially because of temperature changes or drought. A small net loss of acreage may occur, but more seeps may be temporarily affected by drought.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Seepage communities have very limited distribution and availability across the landscape and are one of the most significant habitat  types of the state for rare plants and animals (TNC and SAFC 2000). Several animal species that are state-listed or rare are associated with seepage habitats, including the Bog Turtle, Mole Salamander, Four-toed Salamander,\nLong-tailed Salamander, Seepage Salamander, Alder Flycatcher, and the common Gray\nTreefrog.</p><p>The priority amphibian associated with mountain bogs are all salamander species, though there certainly are a much larger number of amphibians found in mountain bogs. These salamanders (e.g., [[Mole Salamander|Mole]], [[Four-toed Salamander|Four-toed]], [[Marbled Salamander|Marbled]], [[Three-lined Salamander|Three-lined]], and [[Spotted Salamander]]s) for the most part require pools of water (preferably fishless) for breeding purposes. The community association is less related to the system being spring fed, muddy, or with specific plant associations than for many of the other priority species associated with the seepage habitats.</p><p>Some of these communities serve as refugia for species for which the current climate is not suitable. They are likely to continue to do so, but warming temperature and changed moisture regimes may make some of them less hospitable to some of these species. At the same time, these communities may become refugia for additional species that are currently common, if the regional climate becomes unsuitable for them. They may be crucial for the survival of some species in the state.</p><p>While moisture levels are probably the most important factor in these communities, some species may be directly affected by increased average or extreme temperatures. Warmer temperatures may cause some species to be lost at certain sites, and this may include some of the most unusual and rarest species in these communities. Warmer temperatures may also allow some more southern species to enter these communities, but the small and isolated nature of these distinctive environments will limit movement of species. The species that depend on cool, moist conditions are more likely to be extirpated if warmer temperatures (especially combined with drought) reduce the suitable habitat  and/or allow other species to invade the habitat.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>The communities in wet pine savannas are Coastal Plain mineral soil wetlands that under natural conditions were frequently burned. With frequent fire, they have an open canopy dominated by longleaf or pond pine over a grassy herb layer. Shrubs are short and sparse with frequent fire, but become dense if fire is suppressed for more than a couple of years. There are three community types in this ecosystem group: pine savanna, sandhill seeps, and wet pine flatwoods.\n*The pine savanna type occurs in flat areas that are saturated or even slightly flooded during the wetter parts of the year. The herb layer is dominated by grasses and sedges and a variety of low shrubs may be present, but are low and open if the savanna is frequently burned. The herb layer usually contains many showy composites, orchids, and insectivorous plants. One of the most notable  features of pine savanna communities is their tremendous plant diversity at small scales.\n*Sandhill seeps occur on sloping seepage areas, where the wettest parts are essentially permanently saturated. They share many species with the pine savanna type but are more heterogeneous and more bog-like in character. In frequently burned seeps, grassy and sedgy areas can have a high diversity of plants, rivaling the pine savannas in species richness at small scales.\n*Wet pine flatwoods communities usually occur in flat areas, though sloping areas are possible. They resemble pine savannas in general structure, with an open pine canopy over a grassy ground cover with low shrubs. Wiregrass is always the dominant herb. Shrubs become dense if fire is excluded. Unlike pine savannas, the herb diversity is low: in many cases, only one to five species may be present in a square meter.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain wet pine savannas as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>The Green Swamp, Holly Shelter, and Sandhills Game Lands and the Croatan National Forest contain good examples of this habitat.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Intensively managed pine plantations, urban  development, a lack of fire, and subsequent habitat  fragmentation continue to threaten these communities. Climate change may exacerbate some of these problems. New alternative energy development in the region, such as natural gas fracking and biofuel harvesting, may be an emerging threat but it is uncertain what direct effect these will have on wildlife. Anticipated indirect impacts will include displacement from loss of habitat  and loss of connectivity due to habitat  fragmentation. Table 4.25 identifies the most important threats and summarizes the anticipated impacts.</p><p>Although no invasive exotic plants are a serious problem in these systems now, early detection and control of invasive exotic species (such as Cogon Grass) will reduce the ecological damage caused by invasives and the cost of controlling  them. Preventative measures such as forbidding sale and transport of invasive species will help reduce the risks and cost. Fire Ants are already a serious cause for concern for many of the animal species that inhabit savannas.</p><p>These systems occur mostly in low-lying areas that are unlikely to become extremely dry even in droughts. Sandhill seeps are probably more vulnerable than other community types in this group because they depend on movement of shallow ground water. Droughts would dry them up, perhaps enough  for plants to experience water stress. Many species excluded from them at present by wetness may be able to invade with drought.</p><p>Increased drought conditions and increased thunderstorm intensity may lead to more wildfires. These systems depend on fire and are often degraded by lack of fire. An increase in wildfires may allow some occurrences to burn in a way that is ecologically beneficial. However, wildfires in drought may be more likely to be too intense or extensive and to harm some species.</p><p>If droughts are frequent enough,  species of drier communities that are currently excluded by wet periods may be able to establish in them. While species of dry Longleaf Pine communities are presumably excluded from wet pine savannas by moisture, most other species are excluded more by frequent fire. Composition is unlikely to change much for sites that can be burned.</p><p>Longleaf Pines are among the least susceptible trees to wind destruction, and it is unclear how significant increases in wind storms will affect them. Pines with nest cavities of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker frequently snap at the cavity site because much of the internal wood has been removed by the birds. General forecasts suggest an increase in severe storms may cause more wind damage to canopy trees, especially to those with woodpecker nest cavities.</p><p>Flammability of pocosins varies with season and a change in seasonal phenology  that makes them flammable earlier in the season would limit prescribed burning in savannas. Changes in phenology  can disrupt pollinator and predator–prey relationships. Warmer temperatures may allow an increase in abundance or rate of spread of Fire Ants and other invasive species. Mild winters, with decreased cold damage, may allow species from the south to move into North Carolina.</p><p>These systems range well to the south of North Carolina. They and their component species are well adapted to warm temperatures. Increased temperatures might increase the range of these systems in the northern Coastal Plain and in Virginia. Most plants in these systems have limited dispersal ability even locally, so any influx of native species from the south is likely to be slow. The widespread conversion of potential sites in this region, the fragmented distribution of examples, and their dependence on fire make natural expansion difficult.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable to persist.</p><p>The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of these communities, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of rocks, soil depth, size of groundwater pools, and amount of overland runoff. These systems are tied to specialized small environments and will be unable  to migrate as the climate changes. Many may change very little, while a few will shrink, will be disturbed by wind or flood, or will change substantially because of temperature changes or drought. A small net loss of acreage may occur, but more seeps may be temporarily affected by drought.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Appendix G provides a list of SGCN and other priority species for which there are knowledge gaps and management concerns. Appendix H identifies SGCN that depend on or are associated with wet pine savannas.</p><p>These habitats are particularly important for reptiles and amphibians where ponds are embedded in savannas or flatwoods; such species include Carolina Gopher Frog, Ornate Chorus Frog, and Southern Chorus Frog. Several reptile species, such as Pigmy and Timber (Canebrake) rattlesnakes and Mimic Glass Lizard, are found in savannas and pine flatwoods away from pools and ponds. Many of the bird species of highest conservation concern inhabit these communities and depend on frequent fire to create suitable habitat conditions (e.g., the [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]], [[Bachman's Sparrow]], [[Henslow's Sparrow]], [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]], [[American Kestrel]], [[Prairie Warbler]]) (Hunter et al. 2001b; Johns 2004). Game species such as the [[White-tailed Deer]], [[Northern Bobwhite|Northern Bobwhite Quail]], [[Wild Turkey]], [[Eastern Cottontail Rabbit]], [[Gray Squirrel]], and [[Eastern Fox Squirrel]] also utilize this habitat for forage and cover.</p><p>Red-cockaded Woodpeckers use these habitats, because they typically have a sparse overstory and open midstory that is preferred by the woodpeckers. Increased wind storm damage could affect canopy structure and topple some nesting cavity trees. Because of the slow reproductive rate and long life span of Longleaf Pine, increased wind mortality would reduce average age and might reduce natural canopy density. This would be detrimental to [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]]s and other species that depend on older longleaf pine trees.</p><p>Three species of insects are endemics or near-endemics to wet pine savanna habitats in North Carolina. Five others are major disjuncts, with their next nearest populations in New Jersey, Florida, or in the case of Rattlesnake-Master Borer moth, the tallgrass prairies of the Midwest. The Coastal Plain Apamea moth appears to have a highly disjunct population in the coastal savannas but also occurs in the Southern Appalachians.</p><p>Fire suppression and a lack of growing-season prescribed burning causes a thick shrubby understory to develop which shades out grasses and herbaceous ground vegetation and greatly reduces  overall plant and animal diversity. Microhabitats and ecotones can be impacted by fire line construction, and a lack of woody debris particularly impacts reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals.</p><p>While all of these species are associated with fire-maintained habitats, the majority depend on having a metapopulation structure to cope with fire, as well as other environmental perturbations. Five of these species have substantially lost their metapopulation structure and have become highly vulnerable to the effects of single catastrophic events, including wildfires. Because many examples of this habitat  are now fragmented and isolated, uncontrolled fire that burns whole patches is a significant threat to many insect populations. In Summer 2009, a backfire to control a wildfire in Croatan National Forest burned the entire known habitat  of the Arogos Skipper; this butterfly has not been seen there or anywhere  else in the state since that fire.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Red Spruce−Fraser Fir forests are considered an endangered community in North Carolina and are ranked the second most endangered ecosystem in the United States (White et al. 2012; Noss et al. 1995, Christensen NL et al. 1996; Rentch et al. 2007). These forests are dominated by Red Spruce and Fraser Fir and occur on the high mountain tops in western North Carolina, generally over 5,500 feet in elevation. The cold climate of the high elevations is equivalent in some ways to the boreal forests of Canada. However, the climate differs from the north in that it is less continuously cold and much wetter, with both rain and fog tending to concentrate on the mountain tops.</p><p>Spruce−fir forests are divided into two natural community types: Fraser Fir forest and Red Spruce−Fraser Fir forest, each with several variants (Schafale 2012). Both communities tend to have dense canopies under natural conditions. A variety of distinctive shrubs and herbs, many of them more common in the northern United States, but some endemic to the southern Appalachians, occur beneath the canopy. Lush beds of moss and ferns cover the rocky soil and abundant fallen logs in some areas.\n*Fraser Fir forests occur on the highest mountain tops, where the Fraser Fir is the only tree species able to survive the cold, wind, ice, and storms in large numbers. Most Fraser Fir forests now exist as patches of dense young trees due to infestations of Balsam Wooly Adelgid, an introduced insect pest that kills adult Fraser Firs.\n*Red Spruce−Fraser Fir forests occur in slightly less hostile environments where Red Spruce and Yellow Birch can also persist in large numbers. Red Spruce−Fraser Fir forests have canopies of remnant spruce trees, many of which are also dying. The least affected sites are the lowest elevation examples, which have relatively little fir.</p>\n<p>Estimates of the amount of spruce–fir habitat are quite variable depending upon a number of factors including the estimation methods and habitat  definition. The [[Partners in Flight Bird Conservation Plan]] for the Southern Blue Ridge (Hunter et al. 1999) identifies over 66,000 acres of spruce−fir forest in the southern Blue Ridge physiographic province and the Southern Appalachian Assessment (SAMAB 1996) identifies over 75,000 acres in North Carolina and Tennessee. The vast majority of these areas occur in North Carolina.</p><p>The 2005 WAP described Southern Blue Ridge Mountain spruce–fir forests as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Spruce−fir habitats in North Carolina are now found within a narrow range of suitable conditions, isolated from each other and the rest of their range. There are currently six significant areas of spruce−fir habitats in western North Carolina, including portions of Grandfather Mountain, Roan Mountain, the Black/Craggy Mountains, the Great Balsam Mountains, the Plott Balsam Mountains, and the Great Smoky Mountains.</p><p>Most of the spruce−fir habitat in North Carolina is located on public land, or private lands with permanent conservation easements, with estimates of 90%–95% in conservation ownership in the southern Blue Ridge physiographic province including North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia (Hunter et al. 1999; SAMAB 1996). However, significant private ownership of spruce−fir habitat occurs in the Plott Balsams and Black/Craggy Mountains, and to lesser extents in several other ranges.</p><p>Red Spruce habitats of lesser size or with somewhat different ecological community associates occur in a few other locations, including Long Hope Valley, Beech Mountain, Unaka Mountain, Unicoi Mountains, and Alarka Laurel.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Given the high number of endemic and disjunct species that use the spruce−fir habitat,  it\nis the one community where threats to biodiversity are the greatest. Much of the spruce−fir habitat  in North Carolina and throughout the southern Appalachians has been significantly altered due to a number of factors including historic logging, fire, exotic insects, historic grazing, and recreational development. Much of the spruce was logged in the early\n20th century and in some areas (notably the Great Balsams) slash fires burned not only the coarse woody debris, but also the organic soil, which has subsequently inhibited the redevelopment of spruce and fir forests over large areas (Schafale and Weakley 1990).</p><p>The removal of mature Fraser Fir from the canopy has profound implications for the spruce–fir ecosystem and the continued existence of several unique plants and animals (Nicholas et al. 1999). Following extensive logging during the last century, it is estimated that as much as 50% of all Appalachian spruce−fir forests were replaced through successional growth of hardwood species (White et al. 2012; Pyle 1984). Several of the species face outright extinction and others, if lost, are unlikely to ever recover within the region.</p><p>The Blue Ridge Parkway was completed through western North Carolina during the latter part of the 20th century. The Parkway traverses most of the high-elevation islands of spruce−fir habitat.  The Parkway and its associated development (the motor road, vistas, and visitor facilities) have contributed to fragmentation and had a significant impact on the amount of spruce−fir habitat  available.</p><p>In the latter part of the 20th century, the [[Balsam Wooly Adelgid]] (''Adelges piceae'') began to have severe negative impacts on Fraser Firs throughout the region, resulting in the death of most of the mature fir of the high-elevation forests (White et al. 2012). Recent negative impacts include insect outbreaks in several areas including Roan Mountain, the Black Mountains, and the Great Balsam Mountains.</p><p>Some research has shown that recent increases in acid precipitation in the Mountains of western North Carolina may have impacts on forest health and productivity, particularly in the high Mountains (Schafale and Weakley 1990; Hunter et al. 1999). While some Fraser Firs remain in certain locations, the majority of late successional fir has been killed and often replaced by young fir, mixed northern hardwoods, and open, herbaceous habitats.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Balsam Woolly Adelgid, air pollution, and climate change are all major threats; however, this habitat  is among the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Many species are currently excluded from these high-elevation communities because of the extreme climate, with winter cold the most likely cause. Mild winters presumably will lead to invasion by species from lower elevations. This will eventually lead to competitive exclusion of distinctive spruce−fir species from the lower parts of their elevational  range (DeWan et al. 2010). The fact that these habitats are so small and isolated from each other could have a negative impact upon genetic health of individual populations, as well as demographic effects upon populations.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Spruce−fir provides critical habitat  for numerous plant and animal species found nowhere else in North Carolina. Twenty species or subspecies of invertebrates are endemic to spruce−fir forests in the southern Appalachians. Another nine are highly disjunct within this region, with their next nearest populations located in New England or Canada (some may turn out to be distinct species once genetic studies are done). Still more such species exist within other insect orders and in other invertebrate taxa such as myriapods, Tardigrades, and land snails. For terrestrial animals, this level of endemism/disjunction is unmatched by any other habitat  group in the state.</p><p>Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel, a federal listed endangered subspecies, forages on conifers and fungi found in high-elevation spruce−fir and hardwood forests. The moist, boreal conditions support the mycorrhizal fungi that grow in association with the tree roots. Habitat destruction and fragmentation from development, as well as alteration from logging, mineral extraction, pollution, and pest species, has reduced available habitat  for the Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel. The highest quality habitat  for the squirrel is the transition zone between spruce–fir forest and the northern hardwood forest, a mix of Red Spruce, Fraser Fir, Yellow Birch, Buckeye, Sugar Maple, and even some beech at elevations above 4,000 feet. Information about Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel can be found in Chapter 3.7 of this document.</p><p>Spruce–fir communities provide critical breeding habitat  for many landbirds of conservation concern according to [[Partners in Flight]] ([[Brown Creeper]], [[Northern Saw-whet Owl]], [[Black-capped Chickadee]]) that are likely endemic to these high peaks (Pashley et al. 2000; Rich et al. 2004; Johns 2004). Local relative abundance of many birds and mammals (e.g., the [[Red Crossbill]], [[Brown Creeper]], [[Pine Siskin]], [[Black-capped Chickadee]], [[Northern Saw-whet Owl]], [[Northern Flying Squirrel]]) has decreased as the availability of spruce–fir habitats has declined. The fact that these habitats are so small and isolated from each other could have a negative impact upon genetic health of individual populations, as well as demographic effects upon populations.</p><p>Many species using spruce–fir forests are flightless, including salamanders and eight species of ground beetles (Trechus sp.). [[Weller’s Salamander]] is at the highest risk of being pushed off the top of the mountain because of climate change. As is generally true for “sky island” species, even those capable of flight (or ballooning in the possible case of the Spruce–fir Moss Spider), they rarely disperse out of their habitat,  if at all.</p><p>All of these species depend on cool, moist microclimates, but the Spruce–fir Moss Spider, ground beetles, and salamanders are particularly susceptible to desiccation and are among the species most likely to be affected by climate change of any in the state.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n[[File:northernhardwood.jpg|frameless|right]]\n<p>Northern hardwood forests are found on high mountain slopes with a cool climate and high levels of rainfall in western North Carolina and are concentrated in many of the same high-elevation areas as spruce–fir forests. The name refers to the resemblance of these forests to those in the northeastern United States, which have similar canopies, but the presence of southern Appalachian endemic species makes the community types in North Carolina different from those in the north. High-elevation climate, slope, aspect, and past disturbance are critical ecological determinants of the distribution of northern hardwood forests today. In general, they are widespread throughout the region owing to their lower elevation range.</p><p>Northern hardwood forests are dominated by combinations of moist-site  hardwoods such as Yellow Birch, beech, Yellow Buckeye, and Sugar Maple. The herb layer is often lush, and may range from low to fairly high diversity. These forests are subject to periodic widespread disturbances, such as ice storms or severe winds, which provide canopy openings, but probably seldom or never remove the whole canopy at once.</p><p>Three recognized variants of this community type are determined primarily by topography and soil chemistry: boulderfield forest, beech-gap, and typic subtypes.\n*In the boulderfield forest, Ice Age freeze–thaw processes have left the ground completely covered with large boulders with very little soil. These areas are dominated by Yellow Birch with a distinctive undergrowth of gooseberries and moss on the rocks.\n*The beech gap subtype occurs in high-elevation gaps and peaks, where beech trees stunted by the wind predominate. In the most extreme cases, the tree canopy may be reduced to shrub size. The trees may be quite old, although small, as growth and reproduction are relatively slow.\n*The typic subtype varies in composition and diversity. Some have a lawn-like ground cover of just a few species of sedges and grasses, while others have a lush and diverse herb layer.</p>\n<p>While the northern hardwood habitat  can be defined in general terms, ecologically, it should be considered in association with spruce–fir forest for the purposes of maintaining ecological relationships and sustainability. Often components of spruce–fir habitats are present in sub-dominant numbers within northern hardwood communities, and increase in dominance along the elevation gradient to a point where spruce–fir becomes the dominant community.</p><p>The 2005 WAP described Southern Blue Ridge Mountain northern hardwoods as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Northern hardwood forests are found throughout western North Carolina on high-elevation sites with abundant rainfall and a cool climate. Generally these conditions occur above 4,000 feet, but more often it is above 4,500 feet. The majority of northern hardwood forests are on public lands and many are in protected status. Significant amounts of northern hardwood forest occur on federally owned lands including US Forest Service (Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests) and National Park Service lands (Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountains National Park), in the Great Smoky Mountains, Great Balsams, Plott Balsams, Black/Craggy Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, and in the vicinities of Roan Mountain and Grandfather Mountain. While most of the available northern hardwood forest is associated with these high-elevation mountain ranges, significant amounts are present in other areas of suitable elevation throughout the region, such as in the Amphibolite Mountains in Ashe and Watauga counties. A small percentage does occur on state-owned lands, and other conservation ownerships (e.g., [[The Nature Conservancy]], local land trusts, etc.).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Development pressure includes threats from a large increase in second homes and recreation facilities. Many nonnative pathogens are a potential problem for several tree species in this ecosystem, including the [[Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]], [[Balsam Woolly Adelgid]], [[Gypsy Moth]], [[Emerald Ash Borer]], and beech scale. The isolated nature of several populations of wildlife, such as the [[Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel]], [[Northern Saw-whet Owl]], [[Black-capped Chickadee]] and [[Weller’s Salamander]], is likely detrimental to the genetic flow and overall long-range health of the species.</p><p>Many of the former fir forests and logged or grazed areas are regenerating into northern hardwood stands, without a conifer component (spruce or fir). Development on private lands, and logging on private and some public lands remain threats, and are likely the most immediate and greatest threats to a significant number of good examples. Climate change, particularly associated drought and wildfire, is the greatest threat to protected examples. However, the threat of climate change is less severe than in spruce–fir forests and the threat of logging and development are relatively greater.</p><p>The aging of many northern hardwood stands has resulted  in closed canopy conditions and decreasing habitat for bird species that rely on diverse understory development, such as the [[Canada Warbler]]. Lack of disturbance has reduced available habitat  for disturbance-dependent species such as the [[Golden-winged Warbler]] and [[Yellow-bellied Sapsucker]] (Hunter et al. 2001a). In turn, the impacts to other wildlife from stand-level disturbance will need to be examined. For example, small mammals in the family Soricidae, such as Masked and Smoky shrews, can respond favorably to forest disturbance in northern hardwoods (Ford et al. 2002), but this may not be true for other small mammals or salamanders.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of these communities, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of rocks, soil depth, size of groundwater pools, and amount of overland runoff. These systems are tied to specialized small environments and will be unable to migrate as the climate changes. Many may change very little, while a few will shrink, will be disturbed by wind or flood, or will change substantially because of temperature changes or drought. A small net loss of acreage may occur, but more seeps may be temporarily affected by drought.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Northern hardwood forests provide habitat  for numerous wildlife species that also rely heavily on spruce–fir forests. Because of the spatial relationship between them, and the fact that they share many ecological components and plant species, northern hardwood forests are critical to maintaining many species of birds and mammals dependent upon spruce–fir habitats. In addition, northern hardwood plant species may be critical components of spruce–fir habitats even in their sub-dominant role. Consider, for example, the fact that many spruce–fir dependent wildlife species are cavity nesters. Yellow Birch, beech, Sugar Maple, and Buckeye often provide more natural cavities and decaying wood than spruce or fir for species such as Northern Flying Squirrels, [[Yellow-bellied Sapsucker]]s, [[Black-capped Chickadee]]s, [[Northern Saw-whet Owl]]s, and other wildlife.</p><p>There is a major concern about salamanders, as this is a key ecosystem group for rare and southern Appalachian endemic species. On the other hand, the bird species are all more common and widespread farther northward, though a few species may become rare in the state. The aging of many northern hardwood stands has resulted in closed canopy conditions and decreasing habitat for bird species that rely on diverse understory development, such as the [[Canada Warbler]].</p><p>At least six taxa are endemic to northern hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians; three others may also fall in this category, but have not yet been formally described as separate subspecies. Additionally, one moth appears to be a major disjunct from the northern Appalachians and several others are likely to have a similar distribution but are presently too poorly known. All species listed for this ecosystem group are likely to be strongly affected by climate change, as well as the effects of increased fragmentation.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Cove forests are some of the most well-known and recognized community types in the Mountains, occurring on sheltered, moist, low to moderate elevation sites. They are characterized  by a dense forest canopy of moisture-loving trees. There are three community types in this ecosystem: rich cove forest, acidic cove forest, and basic mesic forest (montane calcareous subtype).\n*The rich cove forest type, occurring in the most fertile sites, has a lush herb layer and relatively few shrubs. The high diversity in all vegetation layers makes this forest of great interest to botanists and ecologists.\n*The acidic cove forest, which occurs in less fertile but otherwise similar sites to those occupied by rich cove forests, is dominated by the more acid tolerant species, and has undergrowth dominated by ericaceous shrubs such as rhododendron, rather than by herbs. Canada Hemlock forests have similarly dense shrub layers and relatively few herbs.\n*The basic mesic forest (montane calcareous subtype) is a geologically restricted community that occurs on rare outcrops of limestone, marble, or dolomite, and is dominated by trees that favor high pH soils. These communities are naturally relatively stable, uneven-aged climax forests, with trees up to several centuries old.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Cove Forest as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Cove hardwood habitat  is well represented in the Mountain ecoregion of western North Carolina, including in the Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests. According to the most recent Southeast Gap Analysis Project (GAP), cove forests comprise a little over 558 thousand acres (nearly 226 thousand hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007). This represents slightly more than 1.6% of all land cover in the state.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>The most pressing problem affecting the cove hardwood habitat is the advent of several exotic pest species which could have a significant impact upon the health of the forest, including the [[Hemlock Wooly Adelgid]], [[Gypsy Moth]], and beech scale, as well as several nonnative plants. Evans and Gregoire (2007) that aldelgid infestation can move across the landscape at 15 km (about 9 miles) per year or faster and can kill trees in two to three years (Trotter and Shields 2009). In fact, the adelgid has already devastated most of the Canada Hemlock stands in the state, such that former mixed hemlock–hardwood stands are now mostly hardwoods, with much lessened evergreen cover available for wildlife during the cooler months.</p><p>Though estimates of the amount of cove hardwoods lost to development are unavailable, the most significant problem affecting this community type is its conversion to other uses. Residential development in mountain coves often differs from development in other habitats of the region because the homes and associated open spaces are often interspersed within the forest. The result may be that direct habitat  loss as a result of the houses and associated structures may be more limited than other types of development.</p><p>Timber harvesting and conversion to other forest types (White Pine) or other uses on private lands in certain areas can also decrease the availability of this habitat in the future. The reduction in quality of the habitat  through fragmentation by roads and driveways and human intrusion can have significant impact upon the wildlife species of the forest (Rosenberg et al. 2003).</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of these communities, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of rocks, soil depth, and amount of overland runoff. Unprotected examples of these forests are most threatened by development and logging.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Appalachian cove hardwood forests represent some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world outside of tropical zones (Hunter et al. 1999). An amazing assortment of trees and herbaceous vegetation, coupled  with topographic, microclimatic, and soil characteristics combine to provide an extremely productive habitat for numerous mammals, amphibians, and birds. High numbers of endemic salamanders are present (Petranka 1998), and population densities of these animal groups in cove hardwood forests make these extremely important habitats.</p><p>Problems of individual species associated with cove hardwood forests include isolation or extremely limited ranges of populations (e.g., [[Cerulean Warbler]]s, [[Crevice Salamander]]s, [[Green Salamander]]s). That could lead to increasing chances of genetic depression or stochastic events having negative consequences for the sustainability of populations. Some bird species which require a diverse understory may be impacted by the aging of stands, which can result in decreased plant diversity until the stand reaches age classes sufficient to produce canopy gaps (Hunter et al. 2001a).</p><p>[[Junaluska Salamander|Junaluska]] and [[Tellico Salamander]]s are highly restricted to habitats within this ecosystem group. Both occupy extremely small global ranges and are likely to be strongly affected by increased drought-, fire-, or storm-created openings in the canopy. Several other salamanders with extremely limited global ranges also have significant amounts of habitat  within this community and are also likely to be threatened by the same set of climate change factors. The same is true for several species of Lepidoptera (such as the Dusky Azure) that are associated with mesic habitats and occur in the southern Appalachians as major disjuncts from the north.</p><p>Some high-elevation cove forests now serve as refugia for species for which the current climate in lower areas in North Carolina is not suitable. They are likely to continue to do so, but warming temperature and changed moisture regimes may make some of them less hospitable to some of these species. At the same time, these communities may become refugia for additional species that are currently common, if the regional climate becomes unsuitable for them. They may be crucial for the survival of some species in the state.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>There are three types of barrens in the state: ultramafic  outcrop barren, diabase glade, and high-elevation mafic glade. Glades located in the Mountain ecoregion are adapted to a cooler, moister climate and may be more drought tolerant than locations in the Piedmont ecoregion. However, mountain locations may be more susceptible to alteration than Piedmont glades because of residential development.\n*Ultramafic outcrop barrens occur on dunite, peridotite, or serpentinite. These rocks are associated with unusual vegetation and endemic species throughout the world because of their unusual chemistry. North Carolina’s only well-developed ultramafic  outcrop barren is tied to specialized soils and is an open savanna-like community with a scattered pitch pine canopy and grassy ground cover.\n*Diabase glades occur in the Piedmont over outcrops of diabase and potentially over other mafic rocks. As with other glade communities, the soil and vegetation are patchy and range from nearly bare rock to patches deep enough  to support trees. The vegetation includes many species shared with other high pH soil communities and some species found on granitic flatrocks.\n*High elevation mafic glade communities are an extremely rare community type, with only three examples known globally. A single known location in North Carolina occurs on a flat exposure of amphibolite in Ashe County. Lichens, including a species found nowhere else (''Cladonia psoromica''), dominate much of the area. Herbs on thin soil mats and in crevices include both lowland species and northern disjunct species. Woody species occur in deeper soils and crevices.</p>\n<p>This natural community description is a new addition to the 2015 WAP.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>This natural community has locations in both the Piedmont and Mountain ecoregions. Piedmont examples are less rare, but a couple of the community types occur only in the Mountains. According to the most recent Southeast GAP analysis, glades and barrens comprise approximately 11 acres (about 5 hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>These communities have been substantially altered by fire suppression, and some of these changes may shift them toward more natural composition. Fire is believed to be a natural part of these communities. Low intensity fires may benefit these communities, but climate change may bring higher potential for wildfires to be severe.</p><p>Species adapted to mafic glade habitats are tolerant of drought and heat. Higher average temperatures, coupled  with drought conditions, will likely increase occurrence of fire. Drought appears to be an important factor in keeping these communities from becoming dense forests. While these are among the driest sites in the Piedmont region, if droughts become much more extreme they may be beyond the tolerance of some of the species.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p></p><p>4.4.5.4 Climate Change Compared to Other Threats</p><p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Climate change is not expected to be a major threat for these communities. Development, logging, habitat fragmentation, and changes caused by fire suppression are the most severe threats. In some areas, excessive deer browse is also a major threat. Climate change appears less of a threat.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>It is uncertain how many priority species are associated with this habitat. [[Bog Turtles]] are known from a bog wetland at a mafic glade in Ashe County. For animal species, mafic glades and barrens are probably best regarded as a minor component. There may be land snail and moth species that utilize this habitat type; otherwise, mammals such as [[Bobcat]]s and [[Raccoon]]s are expected to utilize this community primarily as a movement corridor. The Gorgone Checkerspot Butterfly is known in the state primarily from an ultramafic outcrop barren community at Buck Creek in Clay County.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Balds are treeless shrub or herb-dominated communities of the high Mountains. The treeless areas do not represent a climatic timberline, and often occur near higher peaks that are forested. The ecological factors creating balds are not well understood. Harsh climate and shallow soil seem to be a factor in some, particularly heath balds, but many examples of both community types are being invaded by trees and, in the case of grassy balds, shrubs. Fire may have been a factor, but many bald sites do not appear prone to fire, and are surrounded by vegetation that apparently did not burn. There are two community types\nin this ecosystem:\n*Grassy balds are open meadows typically dominated by mountain oatgrass and sedges, with a fairly diverse mixture of other species. They usually occur on broad ridgetops.\n*Heath balds are dense thickets of tall shrubs. Catawba Rhododendron and Mountain Laurel are the most common dominants. An unusual dominant at Roan Mountain is Green Alder, not found elsewhere  in North Carolina. Most heath balds are on sharp spur ridges, but some occur on rounded peaks or ridgetops.</p>\n<p>High-elevation communities are characterized by cool temperatures, relatively high moisture levels within forests, short growing seasons, exposed rock and acidic soils, and extreme weather events. Canopy trees are often misshapen due to persistent strong winds. Open (sparse-to-no tree canopy) communities such as heath or grassy balds and rock outcrops are scattered throughout. [[Spreading Avens]] (a federally listed endangered plant species) is endemic to high-elevation grassy balds (Wear and Greis 2012).</p><p>It has been discovered that some places that superficially resemble balds were cleared of forest in historical times, but other balds apparently were open throughout history. The presence of disjunct species which require open habitat suggests that some balds have been open since the Ice Age. Large herbivores, such as Elk and Bison may have kept grassy balds open through grazing. Another possibility is that Native Americans worked to keep grassy balds open for game by burning or by other clearing methods.</p><p>This natural community description is a new addition to the Wildlife Action Plan.\n<p>Grass and heath balds occur only in the highest mountain ranges of western North Carolina, notably in the Great Smokies, Plott Balsams, Great Balsams, Black/Craggy Mountains, Grandfather Mountain, Roan Mountain, and in the Amphibolite Mountains of Ashe County (NCWRC 2005). According to the most recent Southeast GAP analysis, grass and heath balds comprise approximately 4,761 acres (about 1,927 hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007). This represents only 0.2% of land cover in the state.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Warmer temperatures, changes in precipitation or fire regime, or climate-change induced competition from offsite plants may threaten grassy balds (Wear and Greis 2012). Grassy balds and some of the heath balds are already seriously threatened by invasion from native trees and shrubs. The current invasion of native trees and shrubs, development, and conversion to pastures or Christmas tree plantations are much greater concerns than impacts from climate change.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The effect of climate change on the species of balds is particularly uncertain. Some species are at their southern range limits and some are northern disjuncts, and these may be directly harmed by warmer temperatures. Some are dependent on seeps or wet areas, and may be harmed by more frequent or more intense drought. Habitat specialists and species with restricted ranges will likely be some of the greatest affected by the combined effects of habitat loss and climate change. Such populations are more vulnerable to extinction by rare events and susceptible to additional stressors such as climate change (DeWan et al. 2010).</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Many wildlife species that use grass and heath balds are threatened by impacts other than habitat loss. [[Timber Rattlesnake]]s are threatened not only by habitat loss but also by being subject to collection, disturbance of hibernacula/gestation sites, and persecution. There has been considerable effort undertaken in the northeastern United States to determine the impact upon [[Allegheny Woodrat]] populations from a roundworm parasite (McGowan 1993; Stone et al. 1993), though no studies have been conducted within North Carolina to assess the level of threat posed to woodrat populations.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>High-elevation rock outcrops are extremely rare, have a very restricted range, and are subject to extreme environmental conditions. These communities occur on ridge tops, peaks, and upper slopes where soils are thin and discontinuous and rock dominates the surface. Even in the most rugged high Mountains they represent only a small minority of the landscape, generally at 4,000 feet in elevation and higher. In contrast, mid-elevations range from 2,000 to 4,000 feet and low elevations are below 2,000 feet. The vegetation is likely to be very patchy, reflecting the variability of the soil. Two community types are part of this ecosystem: high-elevation granitic domes and high-elevation rocky summits.\n*High-elevation granitic domes occur on the exfoliated outcrops that form when massive granitic rock breaks off in sheets parallel to the surface. Exfoliation produces smooth dome-shaped outcrops that lack crevices. Lichens and mosses occur on the bare rock. Soil and vegetation develop together on the rock surface as moss mats gradually deepen and are invaded by a succession of herbs. Soil mats are not anchored to the rock below and eventually fall off or are pulled up by falling trees, leaving the rock bare again. The shallow soils are generally dry, but some zones of seepage are usually present on the edge of the soil of adjacent forests. A number of wetland plants can occur in these saturated areas.\n*High-elevation rocky summit communities occur on fractured rock. The bare rock is similarly vegetated by patches of lichen and moss, and shallow soil mats may develop locally. The presence of fractures, however, offers patches of deeper, more permanent soil that can support deeper rooted plants, and can provide an opportunity to anchor soil mats. The vegetation pattern is less likely to shift over time.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes high elevation rock outcrops in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>High-elevation cliffs and rock outcrops occur only in the highest mountain ranges within the Mountain ecoregion in the Great Smokies, Plott Balsams, Great Balsams, Black/Craggy Mountains, Grandfather Mountain, Roan Mountain, and in the Amphibolite Mountains of Ashe County. According to the most recent Southeast GAP analysis, rocky summit and granitic domes comprise approximately 1,180 acres (about 478 hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>The conditions present at individual rock outcrops are unique, owing to geology, geography, elevation, moisture, and landscape position. They may contain discrete communities or they may be dispersed among a variety of other community types that are connected through local geology and landscape conditions. As such, the extent of habitat that each rock outcrop provides is dependent upon the entire set of conditions in and surrounding the surface rock. Those conditions influence its use by plants and animals dependent upon the surface rock and may include significant amounts of adjacent ecological community types.</p><p>Common threats across the range of high-elevation rock outcrops include recreation, development, and forest succession. The two major problems most associated with low-elevation rock outcrops include development and recreational impacts. However, low-elevation rock outcrops are subjected to short-term habitat alterations (e.g., forestry operations) more often than high-elevation rock outcrops due to land ownership patterns, proximity to markets, accessibility, and other factors.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is not the most severe threat, a combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist.</p><p>The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples of these communities, depending on topographic sheltering, configuration of rocks and soil depth. These systems are tied to specialized small environments and will be unable  to migrate as the climate changes. Many may change very little, while a few will shrink, will be disturbed by wind or flood, or will change substantially because of temperature changes or drought.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>While high-elevation rock outcrop habitat  and low-elevation cliffs/rock outcrops support many of the same animals and plants, there are species of both plants and animals that are found exclusively at high-elevation rock communities (e.g., the [[Rock Vole]], [[Long-tailed Shrew]], [[Allegheny Woodrat]], and several rare plant species), and others found only in low-elevation cliffs/rock outcrop habitats (e.g., the [[Southern Appalachian Woodrat]], [[Spotted Skunk]], and [[Crevice Salamander|Crevice]], [[Green Salamander|Green]], and [[Southern Zigzag salamander]]s). The elevation limit for each of these species varies; however, there are distinctions in animal assemblages in rock habitats that are defined by elevation.</p><p>For many species associated with high-elevation rock outcrops, we do not currently know the entire spectrum of threats that are affecting populations due to inadequate levels of study or knowledge. Individual wildlife and plant species may face threats specific to either their particular location or the species itself. For example, [[Timber Rattlesnakes]] face threats in addition to habitat loss, including being subject to collection, disturbance of hibernacula/gestation sites, and persecution. There has been considerable effort undertaken in the northeastern United States to determine the impact upon [[Allegheny Woodrat]] populations from a roundworm parasite that may have impacted populations in that region (McGowan 1993; Stone et al. 1993), though no studies have been conducted within North Carolina to assess the level of threat posed to North Carolina woodrat populations.</p><p>The decline of [[Peregrine Falcon]]s during the last half of the 20th century has been widely attributed to the use of DDT and its concomitant effect on bird reproduction. The use of DDT was banned and [[Peregrine Falcon]] restoration efforts occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s; however the falcons still face threats due to habitat loss to development and recreation impacts at individual cliff sites. Furthermore, the North Carolina population remains at fairly low density, thereby increasing the threat of stochastic events having significant population impacts.</p><p>The insect fauna of high-elevation rock outcrops is not yet well studied and a number of additional species may yet be added. The landscape requirements of these guilds also need more study. Two endemic spiders in the Lampshade genus (''Hypochilus'') would be particularly vulnerable to extinction if they are intolerant to increases in temperature and drought, which seems likely (Huff and Coyle 1992). Their current restriction to extremely small ranges suggests that they have only a low level of dispersal ability and may be unable  to shift their ranges fast enough to keep up with environmental change. Competition with the more widespread Lampshade Weaver (''H. pococki'') spider may further limit their ability to shift their ranges.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>This broad ecosystem group encompasses many, though not all, of the community types at low to mid-elevations that are too steep or rocky to support a closed tree canopy. The vegetation of these communities is generally very patchy, reflecting extreme variability in the depth and composition of soil and of available moisture. Plants include forest species with broad site tolerances, species characteristic of a wide range of open habitats, and species specialized for rock outcrops. Rock outcrops typically are very dry, but seepage zones are often present and may support wetland vegetation. This community type generally occurs below 2,000 feet in elevation. In contrast, mid-elevations range from 2,000 to 4,000 feet and high elevations are above 4,000 feet.</p><p>The nine natural cliff and rock outcrop community types are separated based on rock chemistry, topographic location, and geographic region, and the latter is an important factor in determining flora. The community types are: Piedmont/Coastal Plain heath bluffs and acidic cliffs; Piedmont mafic and calcareous cliffs; montane mafic, calcareous, and acidic cliffs; and low-elevation granitic domes and rocky summits.\n*Low-elevation rocky summit communities occur in exposed positions on peaks, ridgetops, and upper slopes in the Mountain ecoregion. Low-elevation rocky summits have fractured rock which allows growth of deep-rooted woody plants in places. Soil accumulates in pockets of varying depth and produces heterogeneous vegetation. Many variants potentially occur, but are not well known.\n*Low-elevation granitic domes occur on exfoliated outcrops of granitic rock, where peeling of sheets of rock parallel to the surface produces a dome-shaped outcrop of solid rock. Soil mats that begin as moss clumps gradually thicken over time and follow a characteristic vegetational succession from herbs to shrubs and stunted trees. The unanchored mats are periodically destroyed by falling off or by being pulled up by falling trees, leaving the rock bare and beginning the succession anew.\n*Cliff communities occur on lower, more sheltered topographic sites. They are generally created by streams undercutting a bluff, but may occur somewhat above a stream. Like rocky summits, the rock is usually fractured and supports very patchy vegetation that includes woody plants rooted in crevices, as well as herbs in soil pockets, and mosses and lichens on bare rock. The Mountain and Piedmont/Coastal Plain types have flora typical of their regions, often combining plants from adjacent communities with typical outcrop plants.\n*North-facing cliffs have a cooler microclimate than the surrounding areas and sometimes harbor disjunct or regionally rare species characteristic of cooler, moister regions. In some cases these species are believed to be remnants from more widespread populations that existed in the Ice Ages. In the Mountain ecoregion, south-facing cliffs may support species more typical of the warmer Piedmont or even Coastal Plain.\n*The acidic, mafic, and calcareous types support different flora that reflect the rock chemistry. Mafic and calcareous cliffs contain calcium-loving species that do not occur on the more common Acidic cliffs. The floristic differences between calcareous and mafic cliffs are more subtle, and reflect differences in the balance of basic elements.\n*Piedmont/Coastal Plain heath bluffs differ somewhat from the other community types in that they have little bare rock. They do, however, lack a closed tree canopy, apparently because of steepness. They are characterized by a dense shrub layer of Mountain Laurel or Catawba Rhododendron, which are otherwise essentially absent in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. These communities occur on north-facing bluffs, and the cool microclimate is believed to be important to these species.\n*Granitic flatrock communities occur on flat to gently sloping exfoliated outcrops of granitic rocks and are scattered throughout the Piedmont region, from Virginia to Alabama. The rock outcrop is generally flush with the surrounding soil and has only minor irregularities. These communities are somewhat related to the granitic dome communities of the upper Piedmont and Mountains in that vegetation is sparse and very patchy. On bare rock, soil mats that accumulate in moss clumps undergo a gradual development, deepening and being invaded by a succession of plants.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes low-elevation cliffs/rock outcrops in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains as a priority habitat  (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Low-elevation cliff and rock outcrop habitat  is spread throughout the Mountain and upper Piedmont ecoregions. Piedmont examples include Sauratown Mountains inclusive of Pilot Mountain, and the Crowders, Uwharrie, and South Mountains. Flatrock communities are found primarily in the eastern Piedmont. Other habitat types are present even into the Coastal Plain, such as heath bluffs.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Conditions vary considerably within this habitat  type, with a significant number having been impacted and/or lost due to numerous factors, while others remain functional “natural sites” and still others are specifically managed to minimize human impacts.</p><p>Low-elevation cliffs and rock outcrops are diverse communities that are expected to have a variety of responses to climate change. While some are dependent on moisture and may be harmed, others may actually benefit from increased drought and fire. This benefit will only be realized if sites are protected from other forms of destruction, and for most, if fire is restored to them through prescribed burning. These communities are naturally rare in North Carolina, due to limited availability of suitable habitat.  Examples need to be protected and managed appropriately.</p><p>As with high-elevation rock outcrops, two major problems most associated with the low-elevation rock outcrops include development and recreational impacts. However, low-elevation rock outcrops are subjected to short-term habitat  alterations (e.g., forestry operations) more often than high-elevation rock outcrops due to land ownership patterns, proximity to markets, accessibility, and other factors. The extent and degree of impact associated with such temporary habitat  alterations is unclear for most species. Regardless of the impacts or problems associated with short-term habitat  modifications, the relative scarcity of low-elevation rock outcrop habitat  across the landscape of North Carolina, and reliance upon it by numerous wildlife species lends greater significance to the need to identify and manage these habitats appropriately to conserve wildlife.</p><p>Some climate change models predict that rainfall will be concentrated during the fall, and there will be increased droughts in the spring and summer. Droughts could favor herbaceous species and grasses in open, dry outcrops, which tend to be rarer than the woody species associated with outcrops. Drought will kill trees on edges and soil islands. This already happens in current droughts, and is part of the mechanism keeping flatrocks open. Increased length or severity of droughts might cause flatrocks to expand at the expense of adjacent shallow-soil woodlands. Herb species associated with granitic flatrocks tolerate drought at present, or grow in the moist early growing season. It is unclear if they are at the margin of their tolerance, or whether they could withstand longer or more severe droughts. Drought in spring would be detrimental, while drought in other seasons might not be. A few additional flatrocks may be opened up by wind throw or drought mortality. Increased storms may blow down trees and pull up soil mats more frequently. Amount of bare outcrop and shallow soil mats may increase at the expense of deeper mats.</p><p>Low intensity fires could expand the open area and benefit some of the rare plants of outcrops. More mesic outcrops such as heath bluff communities are more likely to be harmed by fire. Landscape fragmentation and fire suppression practices likely will continue to prevent most fires from spreading very far. The central parts of granitic flatrocks are unlikely to burn even in droughts. Fire could affect the dry woodlands that form the edge zone of the flatrocks. However, most flatrocks occur in fragmented landscapes where fire is unlikely to spread. They are likely altered by lack of fire.</p><p>Increased temperatures could increase demand for water, a limited resource in these\nsites. Phenological shifts (earlier bloom periods, emergence from hibernation, nesting and breeding) in seasons may occur in a warmer climate. Exotic plants readily invade favorable microsites on many outcrops. Increased disruption of adjacent forests may bring seed sources closer to many outcrops.</p><p>Dense woody vegetation around edges may become more open. Increased drought or fire might produce beneficial structural changes. Some outcrops have been altered by fire suppression  and these changes may help return to more natural composition. Others will lose characteristic mesophytic species. The effect may be severe in a small number of outcrops. Some dry outcrops may expand into adjacent forests, while heath bluffs may shrink.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Granitic flatrocks are tied to specialized sites and cannot migrate. Communities will change in situ but it is uncertain how much. As with high-elevation rock outcrops, the two major problems most associated with the low-elevation rock outcrops include development and recreational impacts. For animals associated with cool, moist slopes or cliffs, particularly in relict situations, climate change represents the most significant threat, particularly in the Piedmont where their populations are typically small and highly isolated. For the plants associated with this theme, climate change is not expected to be a major threat. Development and changes caused by fire suppression are the most severe threats. In some areas, excessive deer browse is also a major threat.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Many wildlife species utilize the rock outcrop habitat  without regard to arbitrary elevational distinction (e.g., Peregrine Falcon), and others will utilize only high-elevation rock outcrop habitats, at least according to what we currently know (e.g., [[Rock Voles]] and Rock Shrews). However, many wildlife species and even more plant species (Schafale and Weakley 1990) are either associated with high-elevation rock communities or low-elevation rock communities. The elevation limits for each species, however, are quite variable. Many low-elevation rock outcrop species of plants and animals are restricted to ranges outside high-elevation areas (e.g., Crevice Salamanders are only found in and around the relatively low-elevation Hickorynut Gorge). Still other wildlife may occur in both high- and low-elevation rock communities, but for various reasons may reach higher densities or have wider distribution in low-elevation rock outcrops (e.g., [[Timber Rattlesnake]]s).</p><p>The extent of habitat  that each rock outcrop provides is dependent upon the entire set of conditions in and surrounding the surface rock. Those conditions influence its use by plants and animals dependent upon the surface rock and may include significant amounts of adjacent ecological community types. Water seepage through rock crevices may provide moisture for amphibians, mosses, lichens, and wetland vegetation. Reptile species may use rocky areas exposed to direct sunlight for basking or use openings amongst rocks for dens.</p><p>No species belonging to these guilds appear to be vulnerable to complete extinction due to the effects of climate change. However, both the Hickory Nut Gorge population of [[Crevice Salamander]] and the Piedmont populations of [[Red-backed Salamander]] exist as isolated disjuncts and are likely to be highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In both cases, extirpation of these populations would constitute loss of significant ecological as well as genotypic variants of their species.</p><p>DeWan et al. (2010) suggest that habitat  specialists and species with restricted ranges will likely be some of the greatest affected by the combined effects of habitat  loss and climate change. They also note such populations are more vulnerable to extinction by rare events and susceptible to additional stressors such as climate change.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Mesic forests occur on sites that are moist but not wet. Mesic sites are among the most favorable environments for plant growth. They tend to support dense forests dominated by moisture-loving non-wetland trees such as beech, Tulip Poplar, and Northern Red Oak. They usually have well-developed understory, shrub, and herb layers. They often contain species that are common in the mountain parts of the state or farther north but are rare in the southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain. Some species may be disjunct long distances from cooler areas. At least some of these disjuncts are remnants of wider distributions in the past, such as during the cooler, moister climate of the Ice Age.\n*Mesic mixed hardwood forests in the Piedmont are generally on north-facing slopes, sheltered ravines, or high terraces on the edges of floodplains. In the Coastal Plain, mesic forests occur in similar sites and also on moist portions of broad upland flats and on small island ridges surrounded by swamps. These sites are naturally sheltered from the fires that are a major natural shaper of vegetation in the Coastal Plain.\n*Basic mesic forests are much rarer than the mesic type and occur on soils that are neutral to slightly basic in pH. They are more diverse than the mesic mixed hardwood forests and they have species that require high pH. The basic mesic forest subtype often has rare and disjunct plant species and both variants of basic mesic forest (marl outcrop and terrace slope) are rare because of the scarcity of basic substrates on the Coastal Plain (Schafale and Weakley 1990).</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes the Piedmont ecoregion and Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain ecoregion Mesic Forest as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>The Coastal Plain and Piedmont subtypes cannot be separated by any particular species, but differ in their overall flora. In the Piedmont, mesic mixed hardwood forest communities occur on mesic sites that have typically acidic soils. Good examples can be found at Umstead State Park, Duke Forest, Hill Demonstration Forest, Raven Rock State Park, and Eno River State Park in the central Piedmont and also examples in parts of Uwharrie National Forest. Basic mesic forest communities are scattered across the Piedmont; good examples are found in Caswell Game Land, Uwharrie National Forest, and Raven Rock State Park.</p><p>Several distinctive variants of these subtypes are recognized in the Coastal Plain, including the swamp island, mesic flat, and bluff/slope variants of mesic mixed hardwood forest, and the terrace slope and marl outcrop variants of basic mesic forests. Examples of the mesic mixed hardwood forest bluff/slope variant are found in Croatan National Forest, Merchant’s Millpond State Park, and Cliffs of the Neuse State Park. Examples of the swamp island variant are found in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and along the Waccamaw River in Columbus County, and examples of the upland flat variant are found in Perquimans and Bertie counties.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>There may be an increase in natural fires (due to increased drought and higher average temperatures), but landscape fragmentation and fire suppression practices will likely continue to prevent most fires from spreading very far in the Piedmont and in the dissected lands in the Coastal Plain where mesic forests occur. Mesic forests occur in sites sheltered from most fires, but wildfire during drought may increase the likelihood or severity of fires in them.</p><p>The importance of drought and hot spells in mesic sites is unclear. Most of these sites are mesic because of topographic sheltering such as north-facing slopes or deep ravines. These sites are buffered from extremes of weather. However, because they contain many species that are not adapted to hot and dry conditions, they may suffer stress from even slightly drier conditions. Although we are not aware of any identified problems from phenological disruption, there may be higher potential for it in these communities than others, because they have many spring ephemeral plants.</p><p>An increase in hurricanes or other severe storms likely would increase wind damage in forests. Increased storm disturbance will increase the potential for exotic plant invasion, especially if a seed source is present in nearby developed or disturbed areas, or has already entered the community. Wind damage is often more severe in forests if there are adjacent openings such as logged or developed areas. If more intense storms increase flood heights, this will affect lower lying mesic forests. If wind throw stimulates salvage logging, this will further increase the damage to natural areas.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The greatest threats to Piedmont and Coastal Plain Mesic Forests are those from development and logging which are ongoing land uses. Climate change is less of a threat than ongoing concerns, but will exacerbate some of them. Although expected threats associated with climate change are the least significant to these forests, increased wind damage, droughts, and warmer temperatures may alter their structure and size.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Fragmentation of mesic forests into smaller or narrower contiguous blocks is a concern for forest interior birds (like the [[Wood Thrush]], [[Hooded Warbler]], and [[Worm-eating Warbler]]), which may occur in lower densities  or suffer lower productivity  or survival in small habitat patches. Fragmentation by roads and development can be problematic for reptiles (especially [[Timber Rattlesnake]]s and [[Eastern Box Turtles]]), amphibians, and small mammals (particularly [[Eastern Mole]]) that suffer high mortality on roads when traveling between forest patches or between mesic forest and other habitats.</p><p>A lack of canopy gaps in this habitat  type has probably lead to a reduced number of some avifauna such as the [[Eastern Wood-pewee]], [[Hooded Warbler]], and [[Kentucky Warbler]]. This reduction in canopy gaps has also caused a decline in midstory and understory vegetation, which has impacted species such as the [[Swainson's Warbler|Swainson's]], [[Kentucky Warbler|Kentucky]], and [[Hooded Warbler]]s, and [[Wood Thrush]]. The reduction in standing snags negatively impacts primary and secondary cavity nesting species and the lack of dead wood on the forest floor impacts herpetofauna and small mammals.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>The vast majority of land in the Piedmont and Mountain ecoregions is dominated by hardwood forests. Less common are dry coniferous forests, which occur at middle to lower elevations in several kinds of specialized sites that are drier than most environments. They occur primarily in the Mountains and are found in a few mountain-like sites in the Piedmont. Piedmont Longleaf Pine forests, although dominated by coniferous trees, are included with the more closely related [[Dry Longleaf Pine Communities|dry Longleaf Pine forests]] ecosystem group rather than here. There are four community types associated with this ecosystem: pine–oak/ heath, Carolina Hemlock bluffs, White Pine forests, and montane Red Cedar hardwood woodlands.\n*The pine–oak/heath community occurs on sharp ridge tops and spur ridges, where shallow soils and exposure to drying winds and lightning prevent development of a closed hardwood forest. Extremely acidic soils, created by leaching and by the acidity of plant leaf litter, may also be a factor. The canopy, typically composed of Pitch, Table Mountain, and/or Virginia pines, is generally open with a dense, tall shrub layer dominated by Mountain Laurel or rhododendron occurring beneath the canopy. Herbs are few and sparse, but characteristic acid-loving species often occur in openings among the shrubs.\n*Carolina Hemlock bluffs occur in settings similar to pine–oak/heath, but usually more on steep bluff-like side slopes. Carolina Hemlock dominates the canopy with a shrub and herb layer similar to pine–oak/heath but possibly more open.\n*White pine forests are poorly understood communities. While White Pine is a common successional tree in mountain hardwood forests, natural forests of it most typically occur on the walls of steep gorges.\n*Montane red cedar-hardwood woodland occurs on shallow soils on gentle slopes. Smooth rock outcrops are usually found in association with it. These woodlands have an open canopy with patchy shrubs and grassy openings. A number of the species suggest that the soils are less acidic than typical mountain soils.</p>\n<p>Dry coniferous  woodlands of the Piedmont and Mountain ecoregions are described as priority habitats in the 2005 WAP (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>These communities occur through the lower to middle elevations, the foothills, and are particularly abundant in the escarpment in the Mountain ecoregion. Pilot Mountain, Hanging Rock, and Crowders Mountain State Parks all have examples of the pine–oak/ heath community. Owing to the relatively low-elevations occupied by dry coniferous  forests in the region, significant amounts of this habitat  occur in western North Carolina upon state-owned lands (Thurmond Chatham, South Mountains, and Green River Game Lands; South Mountains State Park; Dupont State Forest).</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Most dry coniferous  woodlands depend on a combination of fire behavior and dry soils, both driven by topography. However, an increase in extreme fires may be detrimental. Increased drought may increase southern pine beetle outbreaks, a major threat to the pine canopy. Fire suppression has caused these habitats to shrink in recent decades. Increased drought may favor pines over hardwoods and allow them to regain some of their lost area even without fire. Increased drought and fire may allow expansion. These communities occur in the driest mountain and foothill sites, and increasingly dry climate may allow them to expand into a broader range of topography and to higher elevations.</p><p>The structural effects caused by fire suppression and southern pine beetles greatly exceed any effect likely from climate change. The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid has already impacted some stands of Carolina Hemlock, though not to the devastating effect as seen in Canada Hemlock stands. Restoration of the structure, composition, and, most importantly, disturbance regimes of these communities will increase their resilience to environmental stressors. Without fire to promote pine regeneration, increased Pine Beetle mortality could hasten the shift from pines to hardwoods.</p><p>Warmer temperatures should allow spreading to higher elevation, but the acreage gain is likely to be limited. It may not occur if fires are suppressed. Increased wind damage may increase loss of mature pines and contribute to ongoing encroachment of hardwoods. Because the characteristic plants are drought tolerant as well as fire tolerant, an increase in drought may help them retain or regain dominance. In addition, if drought contributes to an increase in wildfire, this may benefit these communities.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>The most significant threats vary among the different community types. Piedmont and mountain dry coniferous  forests will likely be resilient to the effects of climate change and may actually benefit from increased fire frequency and drought. Lack of fire is the greatest threat to the majority of remaining pine–oak/heath. Not only will these forests not be able to reproduce themselves without fire, but those stands at higher elevations which are not regularly burned often develop dense Mountain Laurel/rhododendron understories that shade out other shrubs and herbaceous plants, thus lowering the habitat  quality and diversity of wildlife which could utilize the area. Management efforts by multiple agencies to increase prescribed fire in fire adapted communities, including dry coniferous forests, are already positioning these communities for greater resilience.\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>While [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]]s are almost exclusively associated with Longleaf Pine systems, most animals that are associated with pines and other dry conifers also occur in mixed stands of hardwoods and conifers. Brown-headed Nuthatches and Chuck-willswidows are also associated with dry woodlands and/or heathlands more generally.</p><p>Additional problems faced by individual species associated with dry coniferous  forest include the lack of early successional habitat  of this type or conversion of this habitat  to other pine habitat (i.e., White Pine) for species such as [[Prairie Warbler]]s, woodpeckers, and nuthatches. [[Timber Rattlesnake]] persecution in these habitats also remains a significant problem. Lack of management of the stands decreases the quality of habitat for woodland hawks by decreasing prey abundance and limiting their ability to hunt in dense understory growth.</p><p>The two species of moths that feed on Bear Oak have a highly confined distribution in North Carolina (as does their host plant). While climate change may create conditions such as increased fire that may favor the oak, the moths are likely to be highly vulnerable to extirpation if fires completely consume all available habitat  in the few areas where the moth currently exists.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>This ecosystem has an oak or mixed hardwood/pine component and occurs on both xeric and mesic sites, in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain ecoregions. (Oak and pine forests in the Mountains are covered in other sections in this chapter.) Oak forests were once the most common natural community type in the Piedmont ecoregion, occurring over most of the uplands. In the Sandhills and Coastal Plain ecoregions, they were much more limited, occurring primarily in dissected areas near streams. They also range across topographic gradients from the Piedmont to some of the highest Mountain ranges.</p><p>The following communities are present within this ecosystem; dry oak–hickory forest, dry-mesic oak–hickory forest, basic oak–hickory forest, xeric hardpan forest, and Piedmont monadnock forest (Schafale and Weakley 1990).\n*Dry–mesic oak–hickory forest and dry oak–hickory forest are the most typical of the five community types, occurring on upland slopes and ridgetops on acidic soils. White Oak is usually the most abundant tree in both. Post Oak and Southern Red Oaks are the primary associates in dry oak–hickory forests and Northern Red Oak and Black Oak in dry–mesic oak–hickory forests.\n*Piedmont monadnock forests, typically dominated by Chestnut Oak and Scarlet Oak, occur on scattered hills, which are resistant to the erosion affecting the surrounding land.\n*Basic oak–hickory forests occur on upland flats and slopes in sites similar to dry and dry-mesic oak–hickory forests, but with soils that are not acidic. Most of the soils are apparently near neutral pH rather than truly basic and usually occur over mafic rocks such as gabbro and diabase. They are dominated by White Oak in combination with Post Oak or Black Oak, and a number of understory, shrub, and herb species that are scarce or absent on acidic soils are present.\n*Xeric hardpan forests are the most distinctive of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain oak forests. They occur on flat to gently sloping uplands with clay hardpans that restrict water and root penetration. This situation is most common on mafic rocks, but it also occurs on acidic shales. These sites may have shallow standing water in wet seasons, but are extremely dry in dry seasons. The canopy is dominated by some of the most drought-tolerant species in the state, Post Oak and Blackjack Oak, and is often somewhat open.</p>\n<p>In addition to these natural communities, there are numerous acres of managed pine plantations, primarily of Loblolly and Shortleaf pines, as well as successional stands of these pines scattered across North Carolina (Huang et al. 2015). Successional communities, which may have a pine stand component, are addressed in [[Successional Communities (Herb, Shrub, Woody)|Section 4.4.17]] in this chapter. Managed stands may be thinned to reduce overcrowding, subjected to prescribed fire to reduce fuel for wildfires, or herbicide applied to control insect or disease attacks. Scientific literature provides evidence that intensively managed Loblolly Pine stands can provide a diverse herbaceous plant community throughout a significant portion of a plantation’s rotation that benefits conservation of biological diversity (e.g., Wigley et al. 2000; Loehle et al. 2005; Miller et al. 2009; Homyack et al. 2014), including species of special concern (Miller 2003; Duchamp et al. 2007; Wigley et al. 2007; Morris et al. 2010; O’Bryan 2014; Bender et al. 2015; Johnson 2015). Intensively managed pine forests may contain a diversity of habitat  types and conditions, depending on different ages of intensively managed stands, different silvicultural treatments, presence of non-intensively managed stands, such as natural stands and riparian buffers, non-forested areas, and the interaction of these habitat  conditions across the landscape (Wigley et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009; Morris et al. 2010).</p><p>The Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain ecoregion and Piedmont ecoregion oak forest (including mixed hardwoods and pine), another description for this community, is described in the 2005 WAP (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Mature hardwood and pine forests are found throughout the Piedmont ecoregion, though the total acreage has been declining in recent years. High-quality  examples of oak forests in the Piedmont can be found on public lands such as Caswell Game Land, Umstead State Park, and Uwharrie National Forest. Examples of large size and good quality oak-dominated communities are now lacking in the Coastal Plain.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Many of the problems impacting oak and mixed hardwood/pine forests, including fire suppression and even-aged forest management, result in a loss of habitat  complexity and associated wildlife niches (Hunter et al. 2001a). Most Piedmont forests have been logged or cleared at least once within the past 300 years, and many have been cut multiple times. The quality of existing tracts ranges widely across the Piedmont and depends primarily upon the age of the canopy trees, management history, and size of the tract (Godfrey 1997). Some native forest stands are being replaced by even-aged pine plantations, resulting in decreased habitat value for forest species that rely on diverse forest composition and structure, such as [[Kentucky Warbler]] and [[Wood Thrush]]. Pine plantations do, however, provide increased opportunity to provide habitat  for [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]] and [[Northern Bobwhite|Northern Bobwhite Quail]], with proper management.</p><p>Sudden oak death disease, which was detected at plant nurseries within North Carolina in 2004, could potentially have devastating impacts on oak forests across the state.</p><p>North Carolina is a major timber producer, with an estimated average 23.2 million cubic meters of wood products produced annually (Huang et al. 2015). Shorter rotation forestry limits the creation of old-growth forest dynamics, such as creation of canopy gaps, hollow trees, snags, and woody debris. In 2002, less than 1% of both hardwood and pine trees in the Piedmont measured greater than 19 inches diameter at breast height (Brown and Sheffield 2003), indicating that there are few old, large trees that help provide these old growth conditions. It should be noted, however, that tree diameter does not always correlate with tree age. Older stands will be more likely to be established and maintained on public land than on commercial forestland, though niche markets for larger timber may entice some landowners to extend cutting rotations.</p><p>An increase in hurricanes or other severe storms may increase wind damage in forests. These effects are likely to be localized. Small scale wind disturbances can create canopy gaps, downed woody debris, and patches of early successional habitat  which can be beneficial to both early successional and mature forest species. Large scale wind disturbances will benefit early successional species but will harm mature forest species.</p><p>Lack of fire is leading to slow changes in composition, including reduced oak regeneration. In spite of benefits from fire, there is a need to control wildfires in drought conditions, to prevent intense fires, and to prevent whole patches of fragmented forest from being burned at the same time. Low intensity fires would be beneficial, but intense wildfires would be destructive. Increased prescribed burning will produce a more open canopy, reduced understory, increased herb cover with more grasses, and longer lasting canopy gaps.</p><p>Direct effects of the warmer climate on these communities are likely to be limited. Similar oak forests range well to the south of North Carolina where normal temperatures are higher. The most severe droughts and hot spells of recent record have had only limited effects on them. They can occupy some of the driest places on the Piedmont landscape. Increased drought may possibly favor oaks, but increased wind damage favors the understory species. If drought leads to severe wildfires, it would be harmful to oak forests, but the ease with which fires may usually be controlled in them makes this unlikely.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While climate change is a significant concern for these communities, several other threats are more severe and may be a more immediate threat. Both the extensive examples in the Piedmont and the more limited range in the Coastal Plain continue to be rapidly destroyed by ongoing urban, suburban, rural, residential and commercial development. Continued population growth makes this the most severe threat, in the current and the future climate. However, the fragmentation and loss of extent caused by it will increase the alteration caused by climate change, as isolated communities are unable to migrate and species are unable to move to more favorable sites.\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Development causes direct loss of forest habitat  and also fragments remaining forested patches. Fragmentation of forests into smaller contiguous blocks is a concern for forest interior birds (like [[Wood Thrush]] and [[Hooded Warbler]]), which may occur in lower densities or suffer lower productivity  or survival in small habitat  patches. Animals with large home ranges or dispersal needs may become isolated or absent in small tracts. Fragmentation by roads and development can be particularly problematic for reptiles (particularly Timber Rattlesnake).</p><p>Historical data suggests that oak communities benefited from periodic fires (Abrams 1992; Close 1996), and many oak species are fire tolerant. In pine stands, fire can play a very important role in reducing the midstory while enhancing structure in the understory. Fire helps to create snags, woody debris, and canopy gaps, and prepares a fertile seed bed, while also improving vegetative structure. The benefit of fire to understory plant development is highly dependent upon the density of canopy trees, with closed-canopy stands suppressing the growth of grasses and forbs following fire. Cavity-nesting birds, arboreal mammals, and some frogs, lizards, and snakes are impacted by the lack of snags, while reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals are impacted by lack of woody debris. Many bird species, such as the [[Hooded Warbler]], [[Red-headed Woodpecker]], [[Eastern Wood-Pewee]], [[Northern Flicker]], Nightjars, and many post-fledging juvenile birds utilize canopy gaps for cover, or for foraging habitat, as do some bat species. Lack of fire has also allowed some fire-intolerant mesophytic plant species to become quite common in oak-dominated communities, including the American Beech (Franklin and Kupfer 2004). The resulting loss of acorn production may be limiting for some wildlife in the future.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

The driest sites are dominated by Chestnut Oak and/or Scarlet Oak, often with an understory of Sourwood, Black Gum, and Red Maple. Today, chestnut persists only as short-lived sprouts from old root systems. Most of the four natural community types recognized within this ecosystem group are broad types with many variants that could be recognized: Chestnut Oak forests, montane oak–hickory forests, high-elevation Red Oak forests, and montane White Oak forests:\n*Chestnut oak forests occur in the driest sites in low to intermediate elevation steep slopes and sharp ridges. Chestnut Oak or Scarlet Oak are the dominant trees, and an understory of acid-loving plants is usually present.\n*Montane oak–hickory forests are dominated by a mixture of oaks, of which White Oak is a prominent part. Hickories are usually a minority component, but are sometimes absent. The understory is generally more diverse than in the other oak forests.\n*High-elevation Red Oak forests occur at medium to high elevations. In the southern part of the state, where spruce–fir forests are absent and northern hardwoods rare, they may dominate the highest ridges and summits. Farther north, they occur below these communities, often in broad zones along mountain slopes. The canopy is usually nearly pure Northern Red Oak. The lower layers of vegetation vary greatly, but share many species with northern hardwood forests.\n*Montane White Oak forests occur at fairly high elevations. They are dominated by White Oak with few other trees.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes this habitat type as Southern Blue Ridge oak forest (including mixed hardwoods and pine) (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Montane oak forests occur in the Mountain ecoregion on exposed sites such as ridge crests and southto west-facing slopes, typically from about 3,000 to 4,500 feet elevation. According to the most recent Southeast GAP analysis, montane oak forest communities comprise over 272 thousand acres (about 110 thousand hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007). This represents less than 1% of the state’s land cover.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>It is unclear if changes in fire regime will be beneficial or harmful to oak forests. Fire suppression has allowed non-fire-tolerant species, including tree species, to increase in montane oak forests. Many oak forests have seen a lack of oak regeneration that is likely related to lack of fire. If a warmer climate brought  an increase in fire, it might offset some of the alterations caused by suppression of fire. Severe fires during droughts would cause extensive canopy mortality and be destructive to oak forests, especially if occurring with the increased fuel loads resulting from recent fire suppression.</p><p>Prolonged or severe drought stress has been associated with oak decline and with canopy mortality. Chestnut blight caused dramatic compositional shift by almost extirpating\nthe American Chestnut. Some more southern or low-elevation species may migrate into these communities. Impacts from higher temperatures, drought, fire, and wind damage will likely lead to other community types, or different suites of species, more suited to the change in climate due to competitive interactions of species in the seed bank during succession. Unfortunately, this may lead to a greater need for nonnative invasive species control after stand replacing disturbances, natural or man-made.</p><p>Homogeneity of stand age has resulted  in decreasing habitat  for bird species that rely on diverse understory development (lack of understory development). Increased wind damage, fire damage, and drought mortality will result in more canopy gaps and a younger average tree age, but may benefit some herbaceous species.</p><p>Drought may allow pine forests to expand at the expense of oak forests, it will also allow oak forests to expand to higher elevations and into more mesic sites now occupied by cove forests. The overall extent of oak forests may increase moderately. These communities should be able to move to higher elevations, while they are unlikely to lose much acreage at lower elevations.</p><p>Princess Tree and Tree-of-heaven are threats. Gypsy Moths and exotic tree diseases (sudden oak death, chestnut blight) are potential future threats. Fire Ants may be able to invade these communities and cause significant impacts if temperatures become warm enough.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Montane oak forests will likely be resilient to the effects of climate change and are expected to continue to occupy most of the sites they currently occur in and to remain the most abundant communities. Development remains the most severe threat to these communities.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>No endemic species are associated with montane oak forests. Only three moths associated with this ecosystem group appear to be major disjuncts. Montane species adapted to cooler high-elevation sites may become locally extinct in the lower elevations of their range as temperature gradients change (DeWan et al. 2010).</p><p>Many species (e.g., [[Black-capped Chickadee]]s, [[Green Salamander]]s, [[Seepage Salamander]]s, [[Crevice Salamander]]s, and [[Wehrle’s Salamander]]s) have such a small range or clumped distribution within North Carolina that they are more susceptible to stochastic or genetic population declines or local extirpations than anticipated climate change impacts. [[Timber Rattlesnakes]] and other snake species are also subjected to persecution, which is an immediate threat.</p><p>Many neotropical migrant birds may also be experiencing winter range habitat  loss. Since there is such abundance and diversity of species associated with oak forests, we may not know the exact habitat  or life history requirements of individual species that are limiting factors to their population stability.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Dry Longleaf Pine communities range from moist sites to excessively drained coarse sands which produce near-desert conditions for plants. Longleaf Pine communities are scattered throughout the Sandhills and Coastal Plain ecoregions and extend into the southern\nPiedmont ecoregion. They were once the most abundant communities in the Coastal Plain, occupying most of the land that was not swamp or pocosin, but now occur as scattered remnants. With frequent fire, Longleaf Pine strongly dominates the canopy, which may range from sparse to fairly dense but is seldom completely closed. A number of variants are recognized within the community types, determined by variation in moisture, soil, and location: Coastal Fringe Sandhill, Xeric Sandhill Scrub, and Pine/Scrub oak Sandhill types, Mesic Pine Flatwoods, and Piedmont Longleaf Pine Forest.</p><p>These communities have in common a regime of frequent natural fires which once crept across vast areas of the landscape. The ground cover is dominated by wiregrass and has a variety of other herbs and low shrubs. The structure and composition of these communities at present strongly depends on the extent to which these fires have continued or have been replaced by prescribed fire.\n*In the three Sandhill community types a sparse midstory of scrub oaks is present, with the species varying with the types and variants. In the mesic pine flatwoods type, oaks are absent and the community has a distinctly two-layered structure of trees and grass. The herb layer is often very diverse. With removal of fire, scrub oaks in the Sandhills community types and shrubs and hardwood trees in the flatwoods community types become dense and out-compete the herbs.\n*Piedmont Longleaf Pine forests are more poorly known. Most existing examples have a mixed canopy of longleaf, loblolly, and shortleaf pine, often mixed with Southern Red Oak and Post Oak. These communities probably once also had a grassy understory, but it is not known if wiregrass was once dominant.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP identified dry Longleaf Pine as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>The best remaining examples of the dry Longleaf Pine habitat  in the Coastal Plain are on the military bases of Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Sunny Point, and Cherry Point, the Croatan National Forest, Holly Shelter Game Land, Goose Creek Game Land, and Sandhills Game Land. Most of the acreages on the above sites are in fair to good condition, due to regular prescribed burning. There are many other sites on both public and private lands where little to no burning has depleted the value of the habitat; these sites would thus be considered to be in poor condition. Piedmont Longleaf Pine forest examples are found mainly in Uwharrie National Forest.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Severe wildfire in droughts or burning with excessive fuel loads may cause ecological damage. For particular species, especially insects, too frequent or too extensive burning (whether by wildfire or prescribed burns) can have major effects when coupled  with loss of landscape integrity resulting from habitat loss. Effects may include some positive (longer growing season) and some negative (pest insect survival). Some of the insects most highly tied to dry longleaf habitats may be eliminated by increases in wildfires.</p><p>The most extreme Xeric Sandhill Scrub and Sand Barrens are dry enough that vegetation density is limited. Increased drought may possibly cause plant mortality and reduce vegetation density further. It may also cause sand barrens to develop in slightly less dry soils. These systems and their component species are well adapted to warm temperatures. Increased temperatures might increase the range of these systems in the northern Coastal Plain and in Virginia. However, the widespread conversion of uplands in this region, the fragmented distribution and lack of seed source for them, and their dependence on fire make natural expansion very unlikely. Warmer temperatures may allow some species of Longleaf Pine systems farther south to move into North Carolina. The limited tendency of most plants in these systems to invade new areas suggests that any such process would naturally be slow and limited.</p><p>Warmer temperatures may allow the invasion of Cogon Grass and Nine-banded Armadillos. Once established, they are likely to expand more rapidly with a warming climate. Fire Ants are already a serious invader in these systems.</p><p>General forecasts suggest an increase in severe storms. Increased drought conditions and increased thunderstorm intensity are likely to produce more wildfire. Increased wind storm damage could affect canopy structure. Longleaf Pines are among the least susceptible trees to wind destruction, and it is unclear how significant increased wind will be to them. Some young planted coastal longleaf stands have shown significant damage from hurricanes and other strong winds. This usually occurs within a few years after the longleaf have emerged from the grass stage. Because of their slow reproductive rate and long life span, increased wind mortality would reduce average age and might reduce natural canopy density. This would be detrimental to [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]]s and other species that depend on older Longleaf Pine trees. Increased plant productivity  with a longer growing season may partially offset the effect of reduced tree age on structure.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The greatest threats to this system do not come from climate change. With their adaptation to dry conditions, fire, wind, and their range well to the south, these may be the most resilient systems to warming climate. Currently, the greatest threat comes from development pressure. Historically, conversion and exploitation destroyed most of this once extensive system, and these forces continue to consume the remnants.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Habitat loss and lack of fire affects bird species that rely on a grass-dominant understory and open pine ecosystems ([[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]], [[Bachman's Sparrow]], [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]], [[Henslow's Sparro]]w, and [[Northern Bobwhite]]). Old growth characteristics (canopy gaps, red-heart fungus, cavities, snags, hollow trees) are lacking throughout, except where [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]]s are managed, impacting both primary (e.g., woodpeckers) and secondary (e.g., rodents, bats, and other birds) cavity users. High-grading of stands, lack of gap management, and overstocked stands are leading to a lack of structural diversity for many species. Roads cause particularly high mortality to reptiles and amphibians.</p><p>Microhabitat features such as large woody debris have been lost, impacting reptiles and small mammals (Loeb 1999). Localized and non-lethal infestations can be beneficial for wildlife by creating snags, a food source, and habitat  diversity. Extensive lethal outbreaks of native and exotic pests can dramatically shift the composition of the tree community, with implications for conifer-specialists like the [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]].</p><p>Wildfires in drought are more likely to be too intense or too extensive, and may harm some species. In small, isolated sites, an increase in wildfires may have catastrophic impacts on insects and other animals that depend on a metapopulation strategy for coping with environmental disturbances. For such species, lack of landscape connectivity can prevent restoration of populations through recolonization from unburned refuges. As a result, there may be a significant increase in local extirpations that may eventually lead to region-wide extirpations or even extinction of certain species. To protect sensitive insect populations, prescribed burns should include setting aside unburned refugias in every burn and preferably following a three year burn rotation among three different burn units.</p><p>Mild winters, with decreased cold damage, are likely to allow species from the south to move into North Carolina. In recent years, several Longleaf Pine-associated insects once thought to be restricted to Florida or the Gulf Coast have been found to be established in North Carolina. Although we lack the historic data to know for sure that these represent recent colonizations, this trend will undoubtedly accelerate with decreasingly cold winters. Fire Ant impacts are also a growing threat.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Woody vegetation on the barrier islands includes well-developed forests with canopies typically dominated by Live Oak, Sand Laurel Oak, and Loblolly Pine; Cabbage Palms are a distinctive component in the Cape Fear area. It also includes the distinctive scrubby woody growth of stabilized sand dunes, dune swales, and sand flats. A few areas on the mainland shore of the sounds share the characteristic species of the barrier island maritime forests. The much rarer maritime deciduous forests are dominated by beech, American Holly, Loblolly Pine, and Hickory on the northern barrier islands.</p><p>Schafale and Weakley’s Third Approximation (1990) classifies maritime forested and shrub communities as Maritime Shrub, Maritime Evergreen Forest, Maritime Deciduous Forest, Maritime Swamp Forest, and Maritime Shrub Forest. Updates to the community description separates maritime forests into Maritime Upland Forest and Maritime Wetland types (Schafale 2012). The Maritime Upland Forest includes shrub, evergreen and deciduous forests, marsh hammock, and coastal fringe shell woodlands in the description. Maritime Wetland Forest includes grassland, interdune marsh and pond, and estuarine forests in the community type.\n*Maritime Upland Forests have relatively low species richness, but a number of species are largely confined to these communities, at least in North Carolina. Such specialized species include Yaupon, Carolina Laurel Cherry, and Devilwood. Salt spray is a major ecological influence on these communities. Where the vegetation is frequently exposed to salt spray, it is significantly stunted. The forest cannot persist in areas with the most severe salt spray and are dependent on the shelter of dunes for their occurrence. Maritime Upland Forests are also subject to the catastrophic disturbances of coastal storms, including high winds, erosion, and saltwater flooding from storm tides and overwash.\n*Maritime Wetland Forests occur in wet sites on barrier islands and near the sounds on the mainland. There are three community types: maritime swamp forest, maritime shrub swamp, and estuarine fringe Loblolly Pine forest.\n*Maritime Swamp Forests and maritime shrub swamps occur on barrier islands in dune swales which are sheltered from the most extreme salt spray and from seawater overwash. The soils are saturated for much of the year and may be flooded for substantial periods. Maritime Swamp Forests have a canopy of tall wetland trees which vary from place to place. Dominants include swamp Black Gum, Red Maple, Ash, Water Oak, Sweetgum, Loblolly Pine, and Bald Cypress.\n*Maritime Shrub Swamps have a canopy of tall shrubs or small trees, usually Red Bay or Swamp Dogwood, which may be tangled together with vines. They are apparently wetter than maritime swamp forests but also may be kept in shrub dominance by periodic disturbance.\n*Estuarine Fringe Loblolly Pine Forests occur on wet flats adjacent to salt or brackish marshes along the sounds. There is often a fairly dense layer of shrubs and greenbriers. All of the dominant plants are species that occur in disturbed wet sites elsewhere  in the Coastal Plain, but these communities appear to be of natural origin. It may be that periodic natural disturbances such as saltwater intrusion prevent succession to hardwoods. It has been suggested that fire occurred naturally in these communities and that the natural aspect was open and grassy rather than shrubby.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP described Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain maritime forest/shrub communities as a priority habitat  (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005). Components in this ecosystem include maritime shrub, evergreen forest, deciduous forest, coastal fringe evergreen forest, and Sandhills communities.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Maritime Evergreen Forest is found throughout the barrier islands and good examples can be found at Buxton Woods, Theodore Roosevelt State Natural Area on Bogue Banks, Brown’s Island, and Bald Head Island. Maritime Shrub is found throughout the barrier islands, but good examples are rare. Some examples exist at Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Shackleford and Core Banks, Brown’s Island, Bear Island in Onslow County, Fort Macon State Park, Bogue Banks, and Fort Fisher. Only one good example of Maritime Deciduous Forest remains at Nags Head Woods in Dare County; an additional example occurs in nearby Kitty Hawk Woods. Maritime Swamp Forest examples can be found in in Buxton Woods and Nags Head Woods. Examples of Estuarine Fringe Loblolly Pine Forests can be found on marsh islands at Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge and higher uplands at Goose Creek State Park.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Any loss will be very significant for these already rare communities. The acreage completely lost from this system by community shifts and destruction may be catastrophic. New sites for these communities may be generated as the coastal landscape changes, but only in places not already destroyed by development. Most barrier island examples occur in complexes that are distant from each other, but connections within the complexes can be threatened both naturally by rising sea level and by human actions such as hydrological alteration.</p><p>With limited dune development in many parts, maritime swamp forests are vulnerable to erosion of the foredunes and increased overwash. If erosion breaches swales and exposes them to sea water intrusion or overwash in storms, they will likely become maritime grasslands. If they are low enough  have irregular tidal inundation, they will become brackish marshes. A lack of fire to maintain some variants of these habitats is also leading to successional changes in many of these sites. Burning is almost impossible to conduct in areas surrounded by homes.</p><p>The net change in acreage of this type will likely be drastic only if sea level rises faster than new examples can develop. Increased natural disturbance by wind, salt spray, and storm surge intrusion will be significant. Some of these communities consist of species that can recover from these disturbances, but increased frequency will result in death and regeneration, more time spent in recovery stages, and shifts toward the most tolerant species.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Climate change may be the biggest threat to remaining examples of this ecosystem group, especially in places where topography or development limits potential for elevational  migration. A combination of synergistic effects with other existing conditions could stress these systems to the point where several species are unable  to persist. Residential and commercial coastal development leading to fragmentation and overall reduction of habitat is the single most important factor leading to the existing loss of this habitat.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>These habitats are important breeding and migration stopover points for many migratory birds, and key breeding areas for populations of the [[Painted Bunting|Eastern Painted Bunting]] (Hunter et al. 2000; Johns 2004). These communities are also important for some snake species for which we have little status, distribution, or demographic information. The presence of dense canopies are a key habitat  element in maritime forests; many maritime forest-associated herpetofauna, and their prey, are adapted to survive under particular sun and shade regimes (Bailey et al. 2004).</p><p>There are feral animal impacts (horses, goats, cows, pigs, cats) on some of the barrier islands (e.g., Shackleford Banks and Brown’s Island). Wood et al. (1987) reported that grazing by ungulates can inhibit expansion of maritime forests. Feral horses have been shown to alter the composition of entire communities through grazing and trampling, though trampling may be the greater impact because it degrades soil structure (Turner 1987; Jensen 1985; Porter et al. 2014). In addition, egg predators such as Raccoons and foxes that typically did not inhabit most of the Outer Banks are now widespread because of the increased amount of food available now that people inhabit the area.</p><p>The [[Buxton Woods White-footed Mouse]] might be the only animal essentially limited to this habitat type. The [[Dukes’ Skipper]] occurs mainly in ecotones of maritime forests and adjacent marshes. All guilds linked to this group are associated with other ecosystems that provide greater acreage of habitat.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Maritime grasslands all occur along the coast and are unable  to support trees because of heavy salt spray or overwash by saltwater during storms. This community includes four types: dune grass, maritime dry grassland, maritime wet grassland, and upper beach.\n*Dune grass communities occur on the line of foredunes just behind the active beach and on unstable sand dunes farther back on barrier islands. The loose, shifting sand with its low water holding capacity and low nutrient reserves makes these environments habitable by only a handful of specialized plant species. Sea oats grass is the dominant plant in most examples, with American beach grass dominating examples in the northern part of the state. Artificial dune stabilization by planting of grasses or placing snow fences modifies the natural dune structure and dynamics. The higher, more continuous artificial dunes are more susceptible to erosion on the front because there are no passages through which seawater can wash.\n*Maritime dry grassland communities occur on more stable sands in the interior of barrier islands. They may be on low, stable, old dunes, but are most typically found on sandy flats on low islands that lack continuous foredunes. Seawater overwashes the low islands during severe storms and kills any invading woody vegetation. The characteristic dominant grass in these communities is saltmeadow cordgrass, though Seaside Little Bluestem occurs in a few examples, and overall plant diversity is fairly low.\n*Maritime wet grasslands may occur on low sand flats or in dune swales at the water table level and are resilient to salt spray and overwash. Some examples may even be flooded for substantial periods. Saltmeadow cordgrass is generally dominant but a great diversity of other species is present.\n*The upper beach type is not technically a grassland, but is closely related to the other community types. It occurs above the mean high tide line behind the intertidal beach. The environment is very harsh for plants, with almost constant salt spray and with periodic flooding and reworking of sand during storms. A handful of mostly annual, salt-tolerant herbs occur as sparse patches and scattered individuals on the sand. Small mounds of sand may develop around the few perennial plants, such as sea oats and marsh elder, forming the beginnings of dunes.</p>\n<p>The 2005 WAP describes the mid-atlantic Coastal Plain beach/dune community as a priority habitat (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Maritime grasslands are located in the Coastal Plain ecoregion on barrier islands and Atlantic Ocean shore areas.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>These communities are well adapted to overwash and this may or may not be harmful to them. It may reverse the artificial exclusion of overwash that has altered some examples, such as those on parts of Bodie and Hatteras islands and the Currituck Banks. Overwash is important for transporting sand to the back of barrier islands, allowing them to migrate landward with rising sea level. Increased erosion of foredunes and possible disappearance of whole barrier islands will substantially reduce acreage.</p><p>This group will likely shrink drastically in the near future. The most extensive examples occur on narrow barrier islands which are most likely to disappear or be substantially altered by erosion. Examples should survive where barrier islands are able to migrate. Examples should survive on larger, more stable, higher islands, and may migrate to higher elevations or expand there at the expense of maritime upland forest and maritime wetland forest. Much of the narrower part of the Outer Banks could disappear entirely (Riggs 2010). With the loss of area will come increased fragmentation, which is already a problem in smaller examples that are isolated by developed areas.</p><p>Barrier islands can be expected to migrate landward, if allowed to, and could survive if sea level does not rise too rapidly. The wider, more stable, and generally higher parts of barrier islands are likely to remain. Grassland communities will also shift and change as the result of increased storm activity and its associated erosion, increased salt spray, overwash, and saltwater intrusion. Increased coastal erosion may breach the foredunes, allowing overwash, which can offset the effects of artificial barriers (e.g., sand fencing and plantings) installed to alter the structure of dune grass communities.</p><p>Increased natural disturbance and milder temperatures can be expected to change composition. Species native to comparable communities farther south may be able to migrate in. Because the harsh physical environment already limits species present, and because the expected changes on surviving islands are mostly increases in processes already active, the degree of compositional change is expected to be limited in most of these communities. Structural changes may be more significant. However the wet grasslands in particular may be more drastically affected. New exotic species may appear or become invasive in the warmer climate, though none are specifically known. Mild winters may allow new exotic species to invade, or may allow more natural compositional change that will be locally substantial but may be negligible over larger areas.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. While the climate is expected to be warmer, and rainfall change estimates vary widely, the most important effects on these systems will be rising sea level and an increase in storms. Table 4.40 summarizes the comparison of climate change with other existing threats.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>A genetic study of the [[Crystal Skipper]] (Atrytonopsis n. sp. 1) indicated that its population is subdivided into three distinct groups, one at Fort Macon and nearby dredged-material island, one at Emerald Isle, and one at Bear Island. These findings indicate that dispersal may be fairly infrequent across ocean inlets as well as wide strips of maritime forest and development. The [[Seaside Dusted Skipper]] is one of the rarest species in the state. Even if it turns out to be an isolated population of the [[Loammi Skipper]], that species is also highly threatened and currently only known to exist in Florida. The Fort Macon population of a moth (''Faronta aleada'') in the Noctuidae family appears to be associated with the same habitat as the Crystal Skipper, but not necessarily Seaside Little Bluestem. Sea level rise may have an effect through increased fragmentation of the restricted range of these species. However, the sites they occupy are among the most stable in this type of habitat  and likely to persist.</p><p>The beach/dune habitat is particularly important to sea turtles, beach-nesting birds, and shorebirds. Many of the bird species rely on the dynamic nature of the beach, and need storms to recreate wide beaches with bare sand and shell overwash areas. The swash zone (the area between high and low tide) is particularly important to beach invertebrates which are used as a food source by fish and waterbirds. These habitats are also well imitated by dredged-material islands within our sounds that are often devoid of the predators that have invaded the barrier beaches.</p><p>Several of the bird species we are most concerned about require early successional habitat for nesting and these habitats have been destroyed or severely altered. Predators (native and nonnative) have increased many-fold; many of these species (cats, herring, and [[Great Black-backed Gull]]s, Raccoons, foxes) were not present before the beach became populated with people and their associated trash. These predators have caused significant problems for beach-nesting birds and sea turtles. Vehicle use has also created disturbance issues as well as direct impacts to nesting turtles and birds. Chronic human disturbance is becoming a problem at many sites. People are now able to access even the most remote beaches via shallow draft boats and personal watercrafts. Direct and indirect disturbance, not only by humans but also by their pets, causes problems for nesting and non-nesting birds.</p><p>Grazing by feral horses is a significant threat to some protected areas, such as Shackleford Banks and the Rachel Carson Preserve and Currituck National Wildlife Refuge. Grazing and trampling contribute to loss of dune elevation (Porter et al. 2014) and has severely damaged the maritime grasslands in these sites. Patches of Seaside Little Bluestem, which support some of the rarest insects in the state, are now almost absent outside of artificial horse exclosures. Wild horses and other large mammals (including domestic dogs) are also generally incompatible with beach-nesting birds. These mammals inadvertently step on nests and chicks, and cause colony abandonment by adult birds.</p><p>Beach renourishment and beach bulldozing can cover or destroy macroinvertebrates in the swash zone and on the beach that foraging shorebirds and surf fishes depend upon. These activities can also destroy sea turtle nests when conducted between May and November. Even under the best survey conditions, all sea turtle nests cannot be found and marked or relocated to prevent take from these activities. Beach renourishment can also lead to more development and possibly decrease washover and increase vegetation, thus decreasing the amount of suitable nesting habitat for beach-nesting birds. Landscaping choices (e.g., introduced species such as Vitex) can also strongly affect the dune system.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>This community type represents large tracts of open land that have not been developed and may have only periodic encroachment from human activities. It may contain a mixture of community types, where vegetation may be natural or a mixture of planted and natural species. Their lack of habitat  specificity makes it difficult to assign these communities to any one ecosystem group, all of which represent distinguishable habitat  categories. These landscapes often serve as movement corridors for wide-ranging animal species, particularly carnivores near the top of the food web. These species often use a wide variety of habitat types in their pursuit of food, mates, and other resources.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>Sparsely settled mixed habitats occur statewide but are more characteristic of the lower Coastal Plain and the Mountains, particularly in areas which have relatively low human populations. Within the lower Coastal Plain, the largest blocks are on the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula, and in the Mountains within national forests.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Development and inundation can be expected to reduce availability of large blocks of undisturbed or unfragmented habitat.  This trend will continue so long as the human population continues to grow and new ways are found to exploit even the most marginal of lands for human uses.</p><p>Sea level rise is likely to affect large areas of the easternmost (outer) Coastal Plain where many important wildlife refuges are located. Inundation of wildlife refuges will result in dispersal inland to Piedmont areas. Movement inland can be expected, but there are far fewer potential refuge areas in the inner Coastal Plain and Piedmont to support viable populations of large predators or venomous snakes than there currently are in portions of the outer Coastal Plain. Movement corridors that allow inland migration away from inundating areas along the sounds and seacoast are critical.</p><p>Increased temperatures are likely to have only a minimal effect on this group overall, although a northward shift in range can be expected for the Least Weasel, a primarily boreal species, perhaps leading to its extirpation from the Mountains of North Carolina.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Climate change will contribute to the loss of the large blocks of habitat or fragmentation that creates barriers between blocks that are critical for the survival of species in this group. Development of habitat has become the limiting factor for priority species utilizing this habitat. Across the state more generally, increased exploitation of wild or semi-wild lands for energy production is likely to be the most important indirect effect of climate change on this group.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Predatory species utilizing this habitat  play an important ecological role in all the ecosystems they occupy by regulating the abundance of species lower down in the food chain, particularly herbivorous mammals. Many of these high-level predators are generalists that have declined in both abundance and range due to conflicts with humans, with the majority now considered to be of conservation concern. Although all of the species included within this guild are highly adaptable and make use of a wide range of habitat  types,\nthe majority are considered rare or threatened in North Carolina. These include the [[Red Wolf]], [[Least Weasel]], [[Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake]], [[Timber Rattlesnake]], and [[Pigmy Rattlesnake]].</p><p>Others, like the [[Black Bear]] and [[White-tailed Deer]], are currently expanding their range across the state and are currently not considered to be of conservation concern. The status of the Long-tailed Weasel is unknown and based on harvest trends, may be declining. Bobcats are common and their populations appear to be stable.</p><p>Sea level rise may lead to inundation of large parts of the Coastal Plain, including the Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula where large reserves have been set aside for Red Wolves, Black Bears, and other wildlife. It is likely several large wildlife refuges clustered around the sounds will be inundated, including Alligator River, Pocosin Lakes, Lake Mattumuskeet, Swanquarter, Cedar Island, and Mackay’s Island National Wildlife Refuges, and the North River, Gull Rock, and Goose Creek Game Lands. Loss or even moderate reduction of these refuges is likely to strongly affect the survival of the pack of Red Wolves that has been restored on Albemarle–Pamlico Peninsula, as well as the largest population of [[Black Bear]]s along the North Carolina coast.</p><p>While some movement inland can be expected, there are far fewer potential refuge areas in the Inner Coastal Plain and Piedmont to support viable populations of large predators or venomous snakes than there currently are in portions of the Outer Coastal Plain. Drought and wildfire may cause animals to range further away from more protected areas as they search for food, water, and cover. This can bring them into conflict with people and roads with high-volume traffic that are common conditions in the Piedmont. Residents in the central Piedmont have expressed safety concerns when [[Black Bear]]s are sighted, and bears have been killed when attempting to cross busy roads and highways, or directly by local law enforcement officials that are not knowledgeable of normal bear behavior.</p><p>[[Black Bear]]s are tied to forested areas, and in the southeastern United States, forest distribution matches the distribution of bears very closely. In many parts of the region, bears are dependent on oak trees for their energy-rich acorns and on a diversity of soft mast species (e.g., blueberries, blackberries). Where oaks are not the dominant species, diversity in forest types and ages can provide mast-producing hardwoods and shrubs. Bears are opportunistic omnivores, but low food supplies and an increase in fragmented habitat  may result in increased bear movement into developed areas and leading to human-caused mortalities (e.g., vehicle, depredation).</p><p>Increased temperatures may cause some latitudinal shifts in the ranges occupied by members of this group, but the effects are likely to be mixed. Least Weasels are probably the only species likely to shift its range as a consequence of increased warming. In the Mountains, they may retreat toward the north, becoming less common or even potentially extirpated from the state. In the Coastal Plain, Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnakes are currently at the very northern edge of their range and very rare in the state. With warming temperatures there is the potential they will increase in abundance. However, that potential could very well be offset by increased development and fragmentation, as well as persecution.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Habitat Page}}\n=Description=\n<p>Successional communities are also referred to as early successional habitats. Successional uplands are dominated by herbaceous vegetation and/or shrub cover because most trees have been removed, either through natural means or by human activity. Where tree species exist they are young and often not much taller than shrubs.</p><p>Successional wetlands are primarily dominated by herb and shrub communities that develop on frequently flooded, semi-permanently flooded, or other wetland sites following disturbance, either natural or manmade. Natural examples of successional wetlands include the communities that form as Beaver ponds become filled-in with sediments, par-\nticularly following abandonment of a pond by the Beavers. Artificial examples include habitats that form along routinely maintained corridors (e.g., power line easements, rights-ofway) and where borrow pits, farm ponds, drainage ditches, or larger reservoirs become filled-in.</p><p>Successional communities can be described as grassland, shrubland, or woody types.\n*Grassland types are dominated by herbaceous vegetation such as mixed grasses, wildflowers, and vines. Examples of this habitat  include fallow farm fields, hayfields, pastures with native grasses, savannas, prairies, meadows, and mountain balds. Grass balds are a unique community and are described in [[Mafic Glades and Barrrens|Section 4.4.5]]. While areas such as ball fields, golf courses, intensively managed horse farms, and mowed lawns are dominated by grasses, they do not provide quality grassland habitat  for priority species.\n*Shrubland types have a mixture of young saplings, shrubs, and woody plants typically less than ten feet tall with scattered open patches of grasses, wildflowers, and vines. Vegetation composition is generally dependent on disturbance frequency and patterns. Hedgerows, clear-cut and regenerating forests, field borders, large canopy gaps, and transportation or utility rights-of-way in dry to mesic uplands are often shrubland communities. Scattered mature trees may be present but not to the point that they shade out the beneficial understory vegetation. Shrubland habitats provide structural diversity that offers a variety of nesting sites, escape cover, and food for wildlife.\n*Woody types represent late stage successional communities that have not developed the characteristics of a specific natural community. Dominant trees in the overstory and shrubs in the understory are often dense and most likely composed of common weedy species.</p>\n<p>The niche that successional communities occupy probably has always existed, having once been associated primarily with openings created by natural disturbances such as storms, floods, or fire. Since they rely on patterns of disturbance to maintain them, these communities are characteristically transient, constantly emerging across the landscape. They are composed primarily of native species of annual plants, reptiles, small mammals, birds, and insects that are associated with successional habitats and are often found nowhere else. While early successional communities can be found statewide, composition and species associations will be highly correlated with the ecoregion where they occur.</p><p>Successional habitats in the Mountain ecoregion may range from broad ridge tops (containing a variety of unique grass and herb species) to lower elevation fields, meadows, pastures, and clear-cuts resulting from agriculture or forestry activities. Montane ‘old fields’ are open grassy areas that have occasionally been invaded by bald species but generally are either in agricultural use or have been abandoned to forest. Human influences, herbivore grazing, and environmental factors such as topographic position, climate, and natural fires have all played a role in the creation and maintenance of montane early successional areas.</p><p>All have been modified by human activity and all are subject to natural succession once controlling  mechanisms, such as grazing or cutting, have been eliminated. Without the return of the management factors, natural succession will limit the longevity of these habitats and their dependent plant and animal species. Though many montane early successional habitat  types support species uniquely dependent on them, other types provide little benefit to plant and animal species, especially those patches of small size, and thus could only be considered marginal wildlife habitat  at best. These kinds of places generally reflect human use and activity as the primary goals of their management and include a number of places such as large lawns, monoculture hayfields, golf courses, residential development, and even urban  development.</p><p>In the Piedmont, Sandhills, and Coastal Plain ecoregions, early successional habitats are often found associated with agricultural or forestry activities and can contain a diverse assemblage of plants, with Piedmont prairies being a notable  example of this (Davis et al. 2002). Historically, the Piedmont contained some prairie-type habitats (Barden 1997) with high plant, and presumably insect, diversity that were maintained through fire and herbivore grazing. Today, remnant tracts of prairie are found primarily along powerline  rights-of-way and sites managed specifically for prairie restoration and maintenance. Successional wetland communities associated with Beaver pond complexes are adapted to frequent disturbances and are likely to be among the most resilient and adaptable to the effects of climate change. By storing water during times of drought and mitigating the effects of flooding, they are also likely to enhance the survival of species found in adjoining habitats as well.</p><p>There are excellent opportunities for quality early successional habitat  of large patch sizes for wildlife on industrial forestland in the Coastal Plain. Intensively managed habitats such as large lawns, golf courses, high production agricultural fields, monoculture hayfields, and intensively managed commercial timber stands often have low species and structural diversity that will have limited habitat  value for wildlife.</p>\n=Location of Habitat=\n<p>This habitat  type can be transient and is difficult to map but it occurs statewide. Powerline easements and other utility corridors are most likely to be perpetually maintained as successional habitat.  Other examples are often found at the transition between agricultural fields and nearby woodlands, created by disturbances like clearcutting, disking, or burning.</p>\n=Problems Affecting Habitats=\n<p>Increased temperature is likely to have a strong effect on the composition of the plant communities in this group. These changes are also likely to affect host-plant specialist insects, but impacts to other animals are difficult to predict. Increased frequency of severe droughts is likely to have a strong effect on the composition of the plant communities in this group. These changes are also likely to affect host-plant specialist insects but impacts to other animals are difficult to predict. With milder winters and warmer average temperatures, Nutria populations could expand their range and become more invasive.</p><p>Beaver ponds can be a nuisance to landowners when they flood farm fields or commercial timber. Their activities cause damage to trees and property, which often results in the destruction of Beaver dams. Several techniques have been developed to minimize Beaver damage while maintaining some benefit from impounded waters. If allowed to continue their expansion, ecosystems in this group are likely to gain resilience and adaptability in the face of climate change. Wetlands associated with Beaver-pond complexes are among the best buffered against the effects of drought. However, prolonged droughts may cause significant local extirpation and hydrologic instability, with increased frequency of severe flooding as well as severe droughts likely to lead to degradation of these habitats.</p><p>Construction of new infrastructure to support development or to move facilities inland  in response to sea level rise can lead to destruction of successional wetlands, especially smaller isolated patches. The hydrologic connectivity of larger wetlands may be affected when crossed by roads or underground utilities. Roads can cause heavy mortality for reptiles and amphibians and can effectively isolate breeding populations, or separate wetland habitats from upland habitats that are used during non-breeding portions of amphibian and reptile life cycles.</p><p>Routine land disturbance by agricultural operations provides the best opportunities for early succession habitat  creation and maintenance in North Carolina. However, the value of modern farmland for early succession wildlife has been reduced as economic pressures, improvements in equipment and herbicides, and social factors have all led to larger, more uniformly shaped rowcrop fields, as well as “cleaner” fields with fewer weeds in the fields and less weedy edge. Few rowcrop fields are managed to include a fallow rotation. Some beneficial practices, such as no-till planting, have had mixed success in being adopted. In pastureland, the extensive use of exotic cool-season grasses has reduced habitat  quality for wildlife. Cutting hay in mid-summer and overgrazing can adversely affect nesting grassland birds.</p><p>Clear-cutting timber creates early succession habitat  for a short period of time until newly planted timber matures and the understory grass, forb, and shrub layers are shaded out, typically 7 to 15 years after replanting. Economic pressures, improvements in timber production practices (e.g., equipment, herbicides, genetically improved  trees) have reduced the amount of time to canopy closure, contributing to loss of early succession habitat.  Intensive site preparation can reduce the quality and quantity of herbaceous cover during the early phases of stand establishment.</p><p>Suppression of wildfires and lack of controlled burning eliminates an important source of early succession habitat  creation and maintenance within many forested habitats.</p><p>Concerns about uncontrolled fire, liability, air quality, social acceptance, and smoke management, and lack of landowners with the experience and equipment to conduct controlled burns have limited the use of fire on private lands.</p><p>Fallow or unmowed areas are seen by many as “messy” and “weedy,” and an indicator of a lack of caring or effort by a landowner. This widespread public perception is partially responsible for fallow habitats being reduced in habitat  quality or eliminated. Early succession cover in powerline  rights-of-way and roadsides is often adversely affected by too frequent or poorly timed mowing. In addition, many areas of fallow ground near houses or businesses are frequently mowed to maintain a neat appearance, while opportunities exist to convert some of these areas to suitable wildlife cover.</p><p>Piedmont prairies contain highly diverse and specialized plant and insect communities. Currently, only small remnant tracts remain. Fire and/or low intensity agricultural operations are necessary to maintain prairie communities. Current restoration efforts are focused on plant conservation and have been implemented on small acreages that have limited value for area-sensitive grassland species such as Grasshopper Sparrow and Eastern Meadowlark. Grasslands larger than 20 acres should be pursued to benefit these species.</p><p>Successional communities are currently among the most heavily infested with exotic invasive species. With increases in overall temperature, more invasions are likely, especially from tropical and sub-tropical regions. Integrated pest management practices should be preferred over more indiscriminate application of pesticides. The effects of exotic plants, insects, and animals on early succession habitat  and native wildlife populations are poorly understood. Impacts are likely to vary widely depending on the species involved, environmental conditions, and management activities. Fire Ants are a species of particular concern, especially regarding their potential impact on herpetofauna, small mammals, and ground-nesting birds. While invasive species should be treated aggressively with eradication as the goal wherever an exotic is just beginning to be established, control measures should always be carefully targeted, including the use of species-specific biological control agents.</p>\n=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=\n<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. The effect of a changed climate is likely to vary widely among examples and many may change very little, while others will change substantially because of human reaction to the impacts of climate change such as temperature changes or drought.</p><p>Loss of habitat  and fragmentation of landscapes are the most significant threats to this ecosystem group. While development of yet more intensive agricultural and silvicultural practices, and loss of still more areas to development, would continue even in the absence of climate change, these impacts are likely to be exacerbated both directly and indirectly by the effects of climate change. Climate change will contribute to the loss of the large blocks of habitat  or fragmentation that creates barriers between blocks that are critical for the survival of species in this group. Development of habitat  has become the limiting factor for priority species utilizing this habitat.  Across the state more generally, increased exploitation of wild or semi-wild lands for energy production is likely to be the most important indirect effect of climate change on this group. Table 4.41 summarizes the comparison of climate change with other existing threats.</p>\n=Impacts to Wildlife=\n<p>Upland Communities. The quantity of early successional habitat is generally not lacking but the quality is often questionable for most species of wildlife. Species found in successional communities occur widely throughout the state, although there are also some regional variations (e.g., [[Henslow's Sparrow]]s are restricted to the Coastal Plain and [[Vesper Sparrow]]s breed only in the Mountains). Changes in plant species composition may also have strong impacts on the composition of insect species, since many have narrow host plant preferences. The vertebrate fauna may show far fewer effects, however, since most, if not all, do not depend on a particular composition of plant species.</p><p>Two species associated with early successional habitats, [[Bewick's Wren]] and Regal Fritillary, are believed extirpated from North Carolina. Several other species are declining, with Eastern [[Henslow's Sparrow]]s, [[Golden-winged Warbler]]s, [[Appalachian Cottontail]]s,  and Grizzled Skippers listed as Federal Species of Concern, and a number of additional rare species tracked by NCNHP. Many of the species associated with this community type that are of conservation concern are primarily northern species and are likely to be significantly affected by the effects of climate change.</p><p>Species in this habitat  group are completely dependent on their ability to disperse from one habitat  patch to another: their habitats themselves are normally very transient and the species associated with them need to keep constantly on the move to keep up with their shifting landscape. Although many of the species associated with successional habitats are quite mobile, small mammals, reptiles, and at least some birds and insects are less mobile and highly vulnerable to the effects of habitat  fragmentation. At least some of the declines noted in this group of species is likely due to decreased connectivity between habitat patches, in addition to the decreased extent of these habitats overall.</p><p>Disturbed and artificially created/maintained habitats are particularly susceptible to invasion by exotic species, which in some cases can have significant impacts on the native species associated with early successional habitats. While most compositional changes are likely to have mixed effects, invasion by some exotic species can produce severe impacts, greatly reducing the diversity of both animal and plant communities. The Appalachian [[Bewick's Wren]] may have been extirpated from North Carolina due to competition with exotic house sparrows and [[European Starling]]s, along with brood parasitism by [[Brown-headed Cowbird]]s, an invasive species in this area that arrived from the Great Plains (Potter et al. 2006).</p><p>Wetland Communities. With stable Beaver populations, Beaver ponds can be maintained for decades. Beaver ponds are a natural community, but result from modification of other community types. With or without climate change, Beaver pond ecosystems are likely to further spread across the state, recreating habitat  conditions that existed prior to the great loss of Beavers and their associated species that began with European settlement of North America. This spread will likely have a positive effect on successional wetland inhabitants. The main limiting factor for this reoccupation is human tolerance for Beaver activities and competition with humans for use of bottomlands. A reduction in the number of Beaver ponds will place more importance on man-made ponds as the primary habitat  for many lentic aquatic species.</p><p>Changes in insect species composition, especially among herbivorous groups, are likely to occur due to changes in plant composition as well as the direct effects of climate change on the insects themselves. Eight very rare species associated with this habitat  group are entirely confined to these habitats in North Carolina, including the federally endangered Saint Francis' Satyr. Vertebrate composition is less likely to change if habitat  structure remains fairly constant.</p><p>While often small in size, cumulatively successional wetland habitats provide critical breeding habitat for many species. Wetland habitats are especially important as breeding sites for amphibian species. Small wetlands can also be important breeding habitat for crayfishes. [[Wading Bird|Wading birds]], [[Waterfowl|waterfowl]], and [[Songbird|songbirds]] may also use small wetland communities for nesting and feeding areas. Dead trees in Beaver ponds are important foraging and nesting habitat  for woodpeckers, such as the [[Red-headed Woodpecker]], and for [[Wood Duck]] nesting.</p><p>Freshwater wetlands near coastal communities provide an important source of fresh drinking water for wildlife, which will become more important in areas subject to saltwater intrusion. Depending on geographic siting in the landscape, successional wetlands may also provide connectivity between adjacent upland habitats.</p><p>Nutria are considered a serious pest species in the United States because they eat a variety of wetland and agricultural plants and their burrowing damages streambank, impoundments, and drainage systems. As warming trends increase, the range of Nutria, a nonnative and often invasive mammal, is likely to expand and populations currently limited by intolerance to cold winters will quickly expand.</p>\n{{NCWAP15 Citation}}\n\n"

The group will collaborate with the Full Annual Cycle Conservation and Science Delivery Teams to identify conservation questions that help make data discoverable, integrate data into regional datasets, and endorse standard protocols. This working group could also provide a forum for outreach around information sharing, translating data for public consumption and identifying additional data needs to address emerging themes for conservation action.\n==Full Annual Cycle Conservation==\nAs the Full Annual Cycle Conservation Team, our purpose is to catalyze conservation of Eastern North America’s landbirds by working with partners from throughout the Western Hemisphere to plan, support and deliver coordinated, science-based conservation for migratory birds across their annual cycle. The development and delivery of Bird Conservation Business Plans — plans that provide a strategic framework for coordinated, multi-species conservation across broad landscapes that link different seasons of the full annual cycle – will be the team’s initial priority. As a collective, we will draw on our different organizations’ strengths and capacities to work together through all stages, from planning to implementation, to improve land bird population trends.\n==Science Delivery==\nThe purpose of the Partners in Flight Eastern Working Group (PIF EWG) Science Delivery Team (SDT) is to build a structure that facilitates expanded use of best management practices (BMPs) as well as useful and practical (win-win) recommendations to benefit birds on public and private lands with the goal of making it easier to implement science delivery to multiple stakeholders.  The SDT will develop action plans and disseminate technical assistance that serve to address five primary issues:\n\n*Land managers overwhelmed by profusion of guidelines (site, ownerships, landscapes.)\n*Public perception of management\n*Long-term capacity\n*Why should landowners manage for birds?\n*Insufficient incentives for private landowners.\n\n"

While these losses are significant, habitat management provides an opportunity to mimic natural processes and restore complexity to our natural systems to ensure the sustainability of a diverse and productive landscape that supports both humans and native bird populations across North America.\n\n=Species Conservation Profiles=\n''[https://partnersinflight.org/species/ from website:]''\n\nThe PIF Watch List includes 86 species—these are the species of highest conservation concern at the continental (range-wide) scale (from Table 1 in the Landbird Conservation Plan). Some of these species are already recognized as federally threatened or endangered in the U.S. and Canada. The Watch List fosters proactive conservation that will help recover populations of the most at-risk species and keep the remaining species from becoming endangered. | Download the Watch List | Watch List definitions explained.\n\nPIF’s mission calls for action to maintain the abundance of all birds fundamental to healthy habitats and functioning ecosystems—Keeping Common Birds Common. PIF identified 24 Common Birds in Steep Decline—species that are still too numerous to warrant Watch List status, but are experiencing troubling long-term declines (see figure 2, p. 11 of Landbird Conservation Plan). All of these species have lost from 50%-90% of their populations since 1970, and most are projected to lose another 50% within the next 20-25 years.\n\n"

SECAS was started in 2011 by the states of the Southeastern Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies and the federal agencies of the Southeast Natural Resource Leaders Group. SECAS emerged as a response to the unprecedented challenges facing our natural and cultural resources, like urban growth and climate change. We see these challenges as an opportunity to coordinate conservation action and investment around a shared strategy.\n==What we do==\n\nSECAS brings together state and federal agencies, nonprofit organizations, private businesses, tribes, partnerships, and universities around a shared vision of the future. We’re working to design and achieve a connected network of lands and waters to benefit ecosystems, species, and people.\n\nSECAS tracks regional metrics of ecosystem health, function, and connectivity to report annually on progress toward achieving the SECAS 10% goal.\n\nSECAS develops the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, a living, spatial plan that identifies the most important areas for conservation and restoration across the region. It stitches together smaller subregional plans into one unifying map—a spatial action plan for achieving the SECAS vision and goal. More than 180 people from over 70 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work. Visit the SECAS in Action story map to explore in-depth examples of how the Blueprint is making a difference on the ground.\n\n\n"

These funds are  generated through federal excise taxes collected at the manufacturers’  level and have been critical to the establishment of long-term agency  conservation planning related to game species.\n\nYet conservation efforts for nongame fish and wildlife species (those that are not hunted or fished) have historically been opportunistic and crisis-driven. This is largely because of limited resources, such as a lack of dedicated funding, and a lack of strategic approaches to species and habitat conservation. With nearly 600 wildlife species listed nationally on the federal endangered and threatened species list, the need for a complementary source of funding for nongame species remains critical for the continued conservation, protection, and restoration of the  full array of North Carolina’s wildlife species.\n\n=Relationship to wiki.ncpif.org=\nThis site is an experiment in progress to make the Wildlife Action Plan more accessible. It is designed to highlight relationships between the species, habitats, projects, and organizations that make conservation possible.\n\n=Versions=\n*[[2005 North Carolina Wildlife Action Plan]]\n*[[2015 North Carolina Wildlife Action Plan]]\n\n\n"

        "description": "\n{{Plan Page}}\n=Executive Summary=\nThe South Atlantic Migratory Bird Initiative (SAMBI) is a vision and process of integrated bird conservation planning and implementation of the Management Board of the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture (ACJV). This vision and process began in 1999 when the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) was emerging as a framework for integrated bird conservation planning in North America. SAMBI is a partnership of traditional joint venture partners (federal, state, non-governmental, and private) and new partners that are dedicated to delivering conservation of “all birds across all habitats” in the south Atlantic coastal plain of the United States. This effort was the first effort of its kind under the framework of NABCI by a joint venture, and this plan was approved by the Management Board of the ACJV in July 2005.\n\nThis Plan provides a regional scale framework for the conservation of waterfowl, shorebirds, waterbirds, landbirds, and upland game birds. This framework utilizes existing national and regional plans of the [[North American Waterfowl Management Plan 2018|North American Waterfowl Management Plan]], [[United States Shorebird Conservation Plan]], [[Partners In Flight Landbird Conservation Plan 2016|Partners In Flight]], [[Waterbird Conservation of the Americas]], and the [[Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative]], to build a framework for regional bird conservation. This framework seeks to integrate common goals and objectives of these national and regional plans, providing conservationists a strategy for meeting the challenge of sustaining healthy ecosystems and healthy bird populations in the midst of increasing threats along the Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe South Atlantic coastline and coastal plain is under extreme threat of commercial, industrial, and residential development. However, there is opportunity to conserve much of the habitat that remains. This plan identifies priority species, priority habitats, priority areas, and strategies to achieve the conservation of “all birds across all habitats” in this region. This Plan is a result of the collaboration of federal, state, non-governmental, and private interests to build a cohesive strategy for bird conservation in the southeastern United States. Pelagic bird conservation is addressed, and international opportunities for bird conservation are also explored. [[South Atlantic Bird Conservation Iniative|SAMBI]] provides a regional framework for the conservation of birds and bird habitats that has implications at multiple scales: local, state, regional, pelagic, international, and hemispheric. \n=Download=\n[[File:SAMBIImplementation_Plan_12_08.pdf]]\n\n\n"
